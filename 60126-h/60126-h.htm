<h2 class="h2herein">PUBLISHERS’ ADVERTISEMENT.</h2>

<p>Our first edition of “Pens and Types: or Hints
and Helps for those who Write, Print, or Read,” was
especially prepared for the benefit of persons connected
with the press. It had, however, a wide circulation
among persons of all professions, and became a reference
book in some notable institutions of learning.</p>

<p>A distinguished lady teacher in a neighboring city
writes us, “I found the book [“Pens and Types”] of the
greatest benefit, both in my work of teaching, and in
the writing I occasionally did for the press. It was an
invaluable aid to those who were trying to train the
young in habits of correctness and accuracy in the use
of their mother tongue. Such a work should never be
out of print, and I am glad there is to be another edition.”
We might refer to many who have expressed
similar opinions.</p>

<p>This second edition contains all that was valuable in
the first, besides several new chapters and additions, as
set forth in the author’s preface: and on account of its
past reputation and the merits of the added matter, we
bespeak anew the favor of printers and teachers,—of
both which professions Mr. Drew
may fairly be <span class="xxpn" id="p006">{p6}</span>
considered a representative; and although he has, in his book,
kept his personality out of sight, even using the editorial
“we,” his fitness for a work of this kind will, we
think, be made apparent by a brief sketch of his career.</p>

<p>After a school life in which he paid much attention to
Latin and Greek classics, he learned the trade of printer.
Soon after attaining his majority, he was employed as
teacher of a public school in his native town, Plymouth,
Mass., whence he was summoned to Boston, to take three
months’ charge of the Bowdoin School, during the illness
and consequent absence of Mr. James Robinson.
Subsequently he became master in the Otis School, which
position he occupied during the whole period of its
continuance.</p>

<p>While residing in Boston, Mr. Drew was a correspondent
of the “Post,” under the signature of <span class="smcap">S<b>HANDY</b>;</span> and
he also contributed the articles of <span class="smcap">D<b>R.</b></span>
<span class="smcap">D<b>IGG</b></span> and <span class="smcap">E<b>NSIGN</b></span>
<span class="smcap">S<b>TEBBINGS</b></span> to Shillaber’s “Carpet Bag.” His contributions
were of a humorous character, and are well
remembered by many gray-bearded gentlemen of Boston
and its environs. From this city, Mr. Drew removed to
Minnesota, where he was Principal of the Public Schools
of St. Paul.</p>

<p>After twenty years of teaching, Mr. Drew returned to
the purlieus of the printing-office, as proof-reader at the
University Press, Cambridge, and afterward with John
Wilson &amp; Son, and Alfred Mudge &amp; Son.</p>

<p>Next he became proof-reader in the Government
<span class="xxpn" id="p007">{p7}</span> printing-office,
at Washington, where for more than nine years he remained, reading
press-proofs of the various Government publications, including many
volumes issued by the Smithsonian Institution, and giving valuable
assistance to the Civil Service Commissioners, in the technical
examination of proof-readers for the Government Departments. At the age
of seventy-six he retired from public employment, and prepared this
second edition for the press. May he live long, and enjoy the reward of
an industrious and useful life—and a huge remuneration from an enormous
sale of his Second Edition.</p>

<div class="section">
<h2 class="h2herein" id="p009">PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.</h2>

<p>As “man measures man the world over,” so it may
be presumed that the experience of a laborer in any
one department of literature will, in the general,
tally with that of all others occupying a similar position.
This volume gives the results of a proof-reader’s
experience, and such suggestions derived
therefrom as may, he hopes, be useful to all who
prepare reading-matter for the press, to all who assist
in printing and publishing it, and, finally, to the reading
public.</p>

<p>But as a vein of imperfection runs through all
human achievement; and as the most carefully issued
volume must contain errors,—so this work, if critically
examined, may perhaps be found to violate, in
some instances, its own rules; nay, the rules themselves
may appear to be, in some points, erroneous.
Still, the inexperienced, we feel assured, will find
herein many things of immediate benefit; and those
who need no instruction may have their opinions and
their wisdom re-enforced by the examples used in
il­lus­tra­tion. So, believing that on the
whole it will <span class="xxpn" id="p010">{p10}</span>
be serviceable; that it contains “a portion” for
“seven, and also” for “eight,” we send this treatise
to press. And if its perusal shall incite some more
competent person to produce a more valuable work
on the topics presented, we shall gladly withdraw,
and leave him, so far as we are concerned, the undisputed
possession of the field.</p>
</div><!--section-->

<div class="section" id="p011">
<h2 class="h2herein">PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</h2>

<p>The extensive circulation of the first edition of
“Pens and Types,” attested by the worn condition
of the stereotype plates, induces the author to present
to his friends and the public a new and improved
edition, embodying the results of a wider experience.</p>

<p>The most important portions of the first edition
have been retained. The chapter on Orthography
has been enlarged by the addition of <span class="smmaj">ONE</span>
<i>correct and
authorized spelling</i> of the many hundreds of doubtful
words—words to which writer and printer <i>can
give but one form</i>, while lex­i­cog­raphers give two or
more. For offices which adopt Webster as the standard,
Webster’s first column has been closely followed;
and for those which follow Worcester’s style, a list is
added, adhering to Worcester’s first column. Some
words of the lex­i­cog­raphers’ second columns are also
placed in the lists (e. g. <i>draught</i> as well as <i>draft</i>),
giving to each word its proper and distinct significations.</p>

<p>Moreover we have in the same chapter placed a
list of all the words ending in <i>able</i>
and <i>ible</i> which <span class="xxpn" id="p012">{p12}</span>
are to be found in ordinary English dictionaries,—whether
words in common use or rare or obsolete,—a
feature which compositors and many others will know
how to appreciate.</p>

<p>A chapter on the Right Use of Capitals, with rules
and examples; and another on Old Style and its ligatures,
with fac-similes from ancient specimens of
typography, give additional value to this edition.</p>

<p>The index at the end of the volume will enable
the reader to find at once any particular rule or direction
contained in the body of the work.</p>

<p>Although originally intended for authors and
printers, this volume will, we are confident, be in
many respects a valuable reference-book for teachers
and pupils in the public schools, and in seminaries
of learning generally.</p>

<h2 class="h2herein">CHAPTER I.
<span class="hsmall">
WRITING FOR THE PRESS.</span></h2>

<p class="pfirst">In
an action recently brought against the proprietors
of Lloyd’s paper, in London, for damages for
not inserting a newspaper advertisement correctly,
the verdict was for the defendant, by reason of the
illegibility of the writing.</p>

<p>“The illegibility of the writing” is the cause of
the larger portion of what are conveniently termed
“errors of the press.” One can scarcely take up a
periodical publication without finding, from editor or
correspondent, an apology for some error in a previous
issue, couched somewhat in this style: “The
types made us say, in our last, something about the
‘Dogs of the Seine’, we certainly wrote ‘Days of
the League.’” We have no doubt that, in a large
majority of cases of this sort, if the question between
“the types” and “the pen” were left to a jury, they
would, as in the case of Lloyd’s paper, decide in
favor of the types.</p>

<p>By dint of hard study, by comparison
of letters in <span class="xxpn" id="p016">{p16}</span>
various words, and by the sense of the context, the
compositor generally goes through his task creditably,
in spite of the “illegibility of the writing.” But
sometimes, in despair, he puts into type that word
which most nearly resembles an unreadable word in
the manuscript, making nonsense of the passage because
he can make nothing else of it. We remember
a great many instances of this sort, in our own experience
as a proof-reader,—instances which, according to
custom, might be attributed to “the types,” but which
were really due to the writers’ carelessness alone.
Thus, in a medical work, it was stated that “This
case had been greatly aggravated by the <i>ossification</i>
of warm poultices to the face”; the author having
intended to write “application.”</p>

<p>Ames’s “Typographical Antiquities” has been made
to figure as “Typographical Ambiguities,”—owing
to chirographical ambiguity.</p>

<p>“The reports in the ‘Times’ and other journals,
never give the name of the Lord <span class="spwdspb">Chandler.” “Chancellor”</span>
was, of course, intended by the writer, but
this was an “error of the press.”</p>

<p>In an investigation touching the field of a compound
microscope, a witness was made to say, “It would
vary with the power of the <i>lye-juice</i> employed.” The
reporter meant to write “eye-piece,” but he succeeded
in writing what the compositor set up.</p>

<p>The title of a book,—“A Treatise on the Steam-engine;
with <i>Theological</i> Investigations on the Motive
Power of Heat.” The latter clause might seem
appropriate to “Fox’s Book of
Martyrs”; but the <span class="xxpn" id="p017">{p17}</span>
transcriber of the title imagined he had written
“Theoretical.”</p>

<p>A toast,—“The President of the —— County
Agricultural Society,—May he enjoy a <i>grim</i> old
age”: the word was corrected to “green,” before
the whole edition of the paper was worked off.</p>

<p>We have seen an advertisement of “<i>Mattlebran’s</i>
Universal Geography,”—no doubt a very entertaining
work.</p>

<p>In a treatise on botany, we have been told, “we
first find those that form the bud, then the <i>calx</i>, the
<i>corrola</i>, the stamina and <i>pistol</i>.” The writer should
have spelled correctly, and dotted his <i>i’s</i>.</p>

<p>A catalogue of hardware to be sold by auction had
an item, “3 bbls. English pocket-knives.” This was
set from “commercial” writing, in which “bbls.,”
or something like it, was used as a contraction for
“bladed.”</p>

<p>“Nature intended man for a social being. Alone
and isolated, man would become <i>impatient</i> and <i>peevish</i>.”
No doubt this is true, but “the types” were
to blame again,—the author fancied that he had
written “impotent, and perish.”</p>

<p>The constitution of a certain corporation appeared
with the following article in the proof-sheet: “The
Directors shall have power to purchase, build, equip
or charter all such steamboats, propellers, or other
vessels, as the engineers of the Corporation shall in
their judgment require.” Why the Directors should
be placed at the mercy of the <i>engineers</i> seemed
unaccountable. But a critical
examination of the <span class="xxpn" id="p018">{p18}</span>
manuscript revealed that the “engineers” were
“exigencies.”</p>

<p>A “Bill of exceptions, having been examined,
and found <i>unfavorable</i> to the truth, is allowed.”
The Justice who signed the above, understood the
word which we have italicized to be “conformable.”</p>

<p>“They could not admit those parts of the testimony
until they had examined the plaintiff in regard
to the <i>poets</i>,”—“facts” should have been written
instead of “poets”; but the “pen” made an error
which the compositor did not feel at liberty to correct.</p>

<p>We have read in a newspaper a description of a
battle-field:—“It was fearful to see: the men fell
in ranks, and marched in <i>pantaloons</i> to their final
account.” This was explained by an erasure and a
blot on the word “platoons.”</p>

<p>It is very easy to say that errors of the kind we
have recited, are owing to the ignorance or carelessness
of the printers; but, on the other hand, when
printed copy is reset, such errors almost never occur,—and
the absence of errors is in direct ratio to the
legibility of the copy.</p>

<p>Men who write much, generally imagine that they
write well; but their imagination is often a vain one.
The writer of the worst manuscript we recollect to
have met with, expressed surprise when told that
printers and proof-readers could not read his writing,
and remarked that he had often been complimented
on the plainness and neatness of his chirography.
His memory was,
no doubt, excellent,—the <span class="xxpn" id="p019">{p19}</span>
compliments must have been bestowed in his juvenile days,
when he was imitating engraved copies.</p>

<p>While one is imitating a copy, he may, indeed,
write legibly, nay, even elegantly; for he has nothing
to attend to, save the formation of the letters. But
when one is writing a report or a sermon or a poem,
his mind is busy with something besides chirography.</p>

<p>The fact is, that men seldom succeed well in doing
more than one thing at a time. The itinerant musician
who imitates the various instruments of a full
band, may be detected in an occasional discord.
Paley remarks that we cannot easily swallow while
we gape; and, if any one will try the experiment, he
will presently be satisfied that in this statement, at
least, Paley was physiologically and philosophically
correct.</p>

<p>Thus, in the haste of composition, ideas crowding
upon us faster than the pen can give them permanence,
we can bestow little thought on mere
chirography, writing becomes mechanical, or even
automatic; and we pay scarcely more attention to
the forms that follow the pen, than we do to the
contractions and dilatations of the vocal organs when
engaged in conversation with an entertaining friend.</p>

<p>Let school training and practice be the same, yet
such are the differences of physical conformation
that handwritings are as various as the individuals
that produce them; running through all degrees of
the scale, from an elegance transcending the engraver’s
skill, down to misshapen difficulties and puzzling
deformity. <span class="xxpn" id="p020">{p20}</span></p>

<p>But however widely our handwriting may vary
from Wrifford, Spencer, or Dunton, it is generally
legible to ourselves, and soon becomes familiar to
our friends and acquaintances. Hence comes the
danger that we shall cease to bestow any care upon
it when others than ourselves and acquaintances are
concerned, and hence it is, that, with scarcely any
consciousness of our shortcomings, we are liable to
impose on an utter stranger the task of deciphering
a piece of manuscript in which not only the
letters have no proper characterization, but which is
smutched with erasures, deformed by interlineations,
and obscured by frequent and needless ab­bre­vi­a­tions.</p>

<p>The loss of time spent in endeavoring to read such
a document, is reckoned among the “small things”
of which “the law takes no cognizance”; were it
otherwise, many of us who fancy that our manuscript
is above reproach, would be astonished at the number
of bills collectible outstanding against us.</p>

<p>The opinion of the “statists,” spoken of in Hamlet,
that it is “a baseness to write fair,” seems prevalent
even in our day. Most men, on leaving school,
instead of endeavoring to improve their chirography,
allow it to deteriorate, and seem to take pride in its
deteriority, and many learned men write as if afraid
that legibility would be considered a proof of intellectual
weakness.</p>

<p>In all other cases of encroaching on the time and
patience of another,—as, for instance, our failure to
fulfill an appointment, or calling at an unseasonable
hour, or seeking advice in an affair
wholly our <span class="xxpn" id="p021">{p21}</span>
own,—we feel bound to make due apology, nay, sometimes
even acknowledge a sense of shame; but who
ever felt regret on hearing that he had put some one
to the trouble of studying, and guessing at, a puzzling
intricacy of cramped writing; his victim being
obliged to seek aid from dictionaries, gazetteers,
directories, and even experts? We never heard of a
man’s suffering compunction on this score.</p>

<p>We say this, referring to ordinary business transactions
between man and man, where bad writing,
except in rare and extreme cases, does not involve
pecuniary loss. But when we are writing for the
press, our duty to write legibly becomes imperative;
indeed, a failure in this respect trenches so closely
upon a violation of the eighth commandment, that it
can seldom happen but from a want of thought as to
the relation between those who write and those who
print.</p>

<p>Compositors usually work by the piece, and are
paid a fixed rate per thousand ems. If a line of type
be divided by vertical lines into equal squares, these
squares show the number of ems in the line. Suppose
there are twenty such squares; then fifty lines
would contain one thousand ems. To set, correct,
and distribute six thousand ems, is considered a fair
day’s work. With plain, legible copy, this can ordinarily
be done; and, at the close of the week, the
compositor receives full wages; all parties are satisfied,
and no one is entitled to complain.</p>

<p>But if, at the end of the week, notwithstanding
the closest application, the
compositor has averaged <span class="xxpn" id="p022">{p22}</span>
but four thousand ems per day, whereby he receives
but two-thirds of the sum he is capable of earning
under favorable conditions, who is morally responsible
to him for the lacking third? We need not go
far to ascertain: a glance at his “copy” answers the
question. He has been laboring upon bad manuscript.
To show the difficulties which have been in
his way, we will put a supposititious case,—closely
paralleled, however, in the experience of almost
every compositor who has worked in a book-office.</p>

<p>He has been setting up a sermon of the Rev. Mr.
Z. The society of the reverend gentleman were so
well pleased with the discourse, that they requested
a copy for the press. Mr. Z. should, of course, have
copied the whole manuscript fairly; for, the haste of
composition being past, he could have re-written it
carefully, paying especial attention to chirography,
spelling out his ab­bre­vi­a­tions, reducing dislocations,
bringing interlineations into line,—in short, he
should have done to the compositor what he would
that the compositor should do unto him. But,
instead of this, what did you do, Mr. Z.? Pen
in hand, you re-read the sermon, making erasures,
striking out some words and interlining others. You
crowded new sentences, of two or three lines each,
between lines already closely written; and you interlined
these interlineations. You then wrote sundry
additions on loose pieces of paper, denoting them as <span class="spwdspb">
“A,” “B,” “C,”</span> etc., and then placed the same capitals
in the body of the work, without sufficiently
explaining that new matter was
to be inserted; <span class="xxpn" id="p023">{p23}</span>
neither did you make it appear whether the addenda
were to constitute new paragraphs. And in this
amorphous condition you allowed the sermon to go
to the printing-office. It has, too, passed through
several hands. Some of the pieces belonging to
“A” have got into “B,” and some of the “B”
have straggled into “C,”—and the printers cannot
say where they do belong.</p>

<p>One compositor finds in his
“take”&#x2060;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn1" id="fnanc1">[1]</a>
the ab­bre­vi­a­tion
“Xn,” and, after many inquiries, learns that
<i>X</i> is the Greek <i>Chi</i>, and so “Xn” signifies “Christian.”
Another hesitates at a phrase which, to his
eye, seems to read “a <i>parboiled</i> skeptic”; but as
modern methods with heretics do not include heated
applications, he asks those about him what the word
is; perhaps goes to the proof-reader with it,—such
things are done sometimes,—for the compositor
expects ultimately to conform to the proof-reader’s
decision,—and thus he loses five or ten minutes in
learning that the word is <i>purblind</i>. Now, reverend
sir, the compositor’s time is his money, and if you
rob him of his time—the inference is obvious.
Your better course, henceforth, will be to copy
your manuscript, or employ some one to copy it, in
a careful, painstaking manner, after all your emendations
of the text have been made.</p>

<p>There is a proverb to the effect that lawyers are
bad penmen, but we think the proverb unjust. So
far as our experience goes, the
handwriting of <span class="xxpn" id="p024">{p24}</span>
lawyers compares favorably with that of any other class
of persons, of whatever profession. It is certainly
as legible as the mercantile style; since the latter,
although generally pretty to look at, is often very
difficult to read,—abounding in flourish and ornament,
which are too often but another name for
obscurity. Sometimes, too, one meets with clerkly
invoices or catalogues, containing remarkably fanciful
capitals; we have seen good readers scarcely able to
decide whether a given initial were a W, an H, or an
N. We are pleased to learn, however, that one leading
“Commercial College” has introduced a marked
improvement in this respect, and now teaches its
pupils a plain, legible hand, instead of a mass of
overloaded ornamentation made not so much to be
read, as simply to be admired.</p>

<p>But members of the bar, like most other persons,
dislike the mechanical labor of copying what they
have once committed to paper. Their arguments,
and especially their briefs, are sometimes sent to the
printer in a confused, chaotic mass; in a shape, or,
rather, with a want of shape, which, if not resulting
from inconsiderateness, would be—we were on the
point of saying—disgraceful. A manuscript of this
sort, covering but six or eight pages of letter-paper,
sometimes requires several hours’ labor in reading,
correcting, and revising, before a presentable proof
can be obtained.</p>

<p>Legal documents are often interlarded with technical
terms in law Latin and old French. Of course
such terms ought to be made as
plain as print. <span class="xxpn" id="p025">{p25}</span>
Usually the principal divisions of a brief are indicated
by large roman numerals in the middle of the
line; the points under these greater divisions, by
roman numerals at the commencement of paragraphs;
smaller divisions, by arabic numerals; and
if still smaller divisions are required, these are
denoted by letters in parenthesis, as (a), (b), (c),
etc. In the haste of writing, however, it is sometimes
found difficult, perhaps vexatious, to keep the
run of so nice distinctions, and arabic numerals are
used throughout, while no proper care is taken to distinguish
the various divisions of the subject-matter
by varying indentions.&#x2060;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn2" id="fnanc2">[2]</a>
The faults of the manuscript
reappear in the proof. This leads to much loss of
time “at the stone”; and as such work is frequently
hurried during the sessions of the courts, the delay
is exceedingly vexatious to all parties concerned. If
one-eighth of the time now spent in correcting, overrunning
the matter, and revising, were bestowed upon
perfecting the copy, there would seldom be any delay
in a well-appointed printing-office.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfnfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc2" id="fn2">2</a>
We do not mean “indentation” nor yet “inden’tion,” but
“indention,” as written in the text. The word is in the mouth of every
printer, proof-reader, author, and publisher: why should it not be
inserted in the dictionaries?</p></div>

<p>When transcripts of records of court are to be
printed, care should be taken that only the very documents
that are intended for the press be sent to the
printing-office. For want of proper attention in this
matter, it not unfrequently happens that certificates
of notaries, extraneous documents, and duplicates
are put in type, to
be presently canceled. <span class="xxpn" id="p026">{p26}</span></p>

<p>We have said something above, touching mercantile
handwriting. Constant practice with the pen gives
facility and boldness of execution,—and where these
are combined with good taste, chirography approaches
the dignity of a fine art, and produces beautiful effects,
and is seen to be near of kin to drawing and painting.
In signatures, especially, flourish and ornamentation
have a double use; they please the eye, and
they baffle the forger. But when lines stand as near
each other as in ordinary ruling, the flourish in one
line interferes with the letters of the next; and the
elegance of a well-cut capital will scarcely excuse its
obtrusiveness, when it obliterates its more obscure
but equally useful neighbors.</p>

<p>Further, business men, deeply impressed with the
value of time, learn to delight in ab­bre­vi­a­tions.
Types have been cast to meet some of these, as the
“commercial <i>a</i>” [@] and the “per cent” [%]; but
the compositor is sometimes put to his trumps to cut,
from German and job letter, imitations of ab­bre­vi­a­tions
which never ought to be sent to a printing-office
as copy. We are not astonished that a merchant of
Boston once received from a Prussian correspondent
a request, that if he, the Bostonian, were to write
again, it might be either in German or in good, plain
English. We adopt the spirit of this advice; and
would say to the banker, the broker, the merchant,
and to their respective clerks, that when they write
for the press, they should drop ornament, drop
pedantic ab­bre­vi­a­tions, drop German, and write in
<i>plain</i> English. <span class="xxpn" id="p027">{p27}</span></p>

<p>We do not know that there is anything specially
characteristic in copy furnished by the medical faculty,
unless it be that their relations of “cases,” both
in medicine and surgery, abound, no doubt necessarily,
in “words of learned length”; which, being
unfamiliar to the laity, should be written with conscionable
care; every letter performing its proper
function, and duly articulated to its neighbors. But
the scientific terms of their art, as written by most
physicians, are, to the average printer, as illegible as
the Greek from which a portion of such terms is
derived. Recipes are seldom got typographically
correct, until they have passed through three or four
revisions. Even apothecaries, it is said, sometimes
put up morphine instead of magnesia; in which case,
unless the revising is done in a hurry with the
stomach-pump, a jury may have something to say
about the “illegibility of the writing.” When
troublesome consequences arise from misapprehension
of a Latin word, or of its meaning, we hear
much said in favor of writing recipes in English.</p>

<p>But, whatever may be said to the contrary, there
are weighty, and, we think, irrefutable arguments for
continuing the use of Latin and Greek terms in
medical writings,—even in recipes. Since it should
be so, and certainly <i>is</i> so, we insist here, as elsewhere,
that all technical terms, proper names, or any words
on which the context can throw but little, if any,
light, should be written not with ordinary, but with
<i>cardinary</i> care,—which new word we hazard, that
our meaning may make
a deeper impression. <span class="xxpn" id="p028">{p28}</span></p>

<p>In passing, we may remark that the mode of indicating
names of remedies comes under the head of
“Style” (see Chapter III.), and varies in different
offices. Names of medicines are often abbreviated,
and set in italics; and when a generic word is used, it
should be capitalized; as, “Dr. I. administered <i>Rhus
tox</i>.” In homeopathic works, the number expressing
a dilution or trituration is placed in superiors at the
right; as, “Ordered <i>Cuprum metallicum</i><sup>100</sup>.”</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>A few suggestions to those who write any kind of
copy for the press, will close this part of our subject.</p>

<p>Write on only one side of the paper.</p>

<p>If you wish to make an addition to a page, do not
write it on the back of the sheet; cut the leaf, and
paste the new matter in, just where it belongs, being
careful not to cover up so much as a single letter in
doing so: we have known lines to be omitted by
the compositor, in consequence of careless pasting.
The leaf having thus been lengthened, you may, for
the sake of convenience, fold the lower edge forward
upon the writing. This minute direction may seem
idle; but when a portion of the leaf has been folded
backward, out of sight, the folded part may very
likely escape notice, and, to insert it, many pages of
matter may afterward require to be overrun: we
have known such cases.</p>

<p>Abbreviate those words only, which you wish the
printer to abbreviate.</p>

<p>Never erase with a lead pencil; for an erasure with
lead leaves it questionable whether or
not the marked <span class="xxpn" id="p029">{p29}</span>
word is to go in. Use ink, drawing the pen horizontally
through the words or lines to be omitted; and
be careful that the marking leave off on exactly the
right word. If you afterward regret the cancellation,
you may write “stet” in the margin, and place dots
under the canceled words; but as “stet” may not be
noticed, in the presence of obvious erasures, the
better way will be to re-write the passage, and paste
it in the place you wish it to occupy.</p>

<p>Take time to write plainly and legibly. In writing
for the press, the old adage holds good,—“The more
haste, the worse speed”; and for every hour you save
by writing hurriedly, you will be called upon to pay
for several hours’ labor in making corrections. Write
joinhand: mistakes often arise from a long word
being broken up, as it were, into two or three words.</p>

<p>I and J are often mistaken for each other. Either
imitate the printed letters, or uniformly carry the
loop of the J below the line.</p>

<p>It is often impossible to distinguish Jan. from June,
in manuscript, unless the context furnishes a clew.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the divisions of your work (as
books, chapters, sections, cantos, and the like), let
your entire manuscript be paged in the order of the
natural series of numbers from 1 upward. If you
commence each division with 1,—as is sometimes
done,—and two or three divisions are given out as
“takes” to compositors, it is obvious that portions
of one division may exchange places with those of
another; and, further, if leaves happen to become
transposed, they can readily be restored
to their right <span class="xxpn" id="p030">{p30}</span>
places if no duplicate numbers have been used in
indicating the pages.</p>

<p>Make sure that the books, chapters, etc., are numbered
consecutively. The best proof-reader must
confess to some unguarded moments; and it would
be very awkward, after having had two hundred and
forty chapters stereotyped, to find that two chapter
V.’s have been cast, that every subsequent chapter is
numbered one less than it should have been, and that
compositor and proof-reader have exactly followed
copy.</p>

<p>Examine your manuscript carefully with reference
to the points. Avoid the dash when any other point
will answer your purpose. A manuscript that is
over-punctuated occasions more perplexity than one
that is scarcely pointed at all.</p>

<p>Before sending it to press, get your manuscript
into a shape you can abide by. Alterations made on
the proof-sheet must be paid for; and, further, matter
that has undergone alterations seldom makes a handsome
page: some lines will appear crowded, others
too widely spaced.</p>

<p>In writing a footnote¹ let it immediately follow</p>

<div id="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst">¹ In many works the footnotes, by a
slight change of arrangement, might advantageously
become a portion of the text.</p></div>

<p class="pcontinue">the line of text which contains
the asterisk, or other reference-mark; just as you
see in the above example, and do not write it at the
bottom of the manuscript page. The person who makes
up the matter will transfer such note to its proper
place.</p>

<p>If you feel obliged to strike out a
word from the <span class="xxpn" id="p031">{p31}</span>
proof, endeavor to insert another, in the same sentence,
and in the same line if possible, to fill the
space. So, if you insert a word or words, see whether
you can strike out, nearly at the same place, as much
as you insert.</p>

<p>When writing for the press, never use a lead
pencil. Let your copy be made with black ink on
good white paper. We have been pained to see the
checkered pages of a report to an extensive religious
association, which report had been in the first place
wholly written with a lead pencil: then words canceled,
words interlined, various changes made,—and
all these alterations done with pen and ink. Of
course, sleeve and hand rubbing over the plumbago
gave the whole a dingy and blurred appearance. The
effect of the ink sprinkled among the faded pencilings
was so much like that of mending an old
garment with new cloth, that the manuscript had
an unchristian, nay, even heathenish aspect. However,
from this copy the report was printed,—let
us charitably hope that it did much good in the
world.</p>

<p>If proof-sheets present peculiarities of spelling and
language, such for instance as appear in ancient
works, and which are affected or indulged in by some
moderns, every word whose correctness he doubts
and is unable to verify, should be referred by the
proof-reader to author or editor. The latter, familiar
with the terms used, may consider some queries frivolous
or puerile; but an author should appreciate
conscientiousness in the reader, and be
glad to have <span class="xxpn" id="p032">{p32}</span>
all doubts settled before his work reaches the eyes of
reviewers.</p>

<p>That Dr. Johnson was guilty of harshness toward
a proof-reader is not to be wondered at; but it is a
matter of wonder that his conduct appears to have
been approved by other editors. In J. T. Buckingham’s
edition of Shakspeare (1814) is, at page 915,
a remarkable note, apologizing for a few “trifling
errors,” and adopting as an excuse a quotation from
an advertisement “from the first edition of Reed,
1793”:</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>He, whose business it is to offer this unusual apology, very
well remembers to have been sitting with Dr. Johnson, when
an agent from a neighboring press brought in a proof sheet of
a republication, requesting to know whether a particular word
in it was not corrupted. “So far from it, sir,” (replied the
Doctor with some harshness,) “that the word you suspect, and
would displace, is conspicuously beautiful where it stands, and
is the only one that could do the duty expected from it by Mr.
Pope.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Johnson’s assumption that the agent <i>would
displace</i> the word, seems to have been wholly gratuitous.
The employees of the neighboring press did
precisely what they should have done,—what every
conscientious proof-reader often feels obliged to do.
If suspected words were passed without questioning,
there would be many errors of the press which would
justify some show of “harshness” toward the neglectful
“agent.”</p></div><!--section-->

<span class="hsmall">
PROOF-READING.</span></h2>

<p class="pfirst">So long as authors the most
accomplished are liable to err, so long as compositors
the most careful make occasional mistakes, so long
as dictionaries authorize various spellings, just so
long must there be individuals trained and training to
detect errors, to rectify mistakes, and to decide upon
and settle all points which lex­i­cog­raphers leave in
doubt. Such individuals are known as Proof-readers.</p>

<p>Movable types, after having been used in printing
newspaper or book, etc., are distributed to their
several compartments (boxes) for future use. In
distributing, the compositor, holding several lines in
his left hand, takes from the top line, between the
thumb and forefinger of his right hand, as many
words or letters as he can conveniently manipulate,
and moving his hand over the case drops each letter
into its proper box. Suppose, for instance, he takes
up the word “feasible”; he carries his hand to the
“f” box, and drops off the first letter; of course he
knows, without looking at the word again, that he
is next to drop off the “e”—and so, very quickly,
his hand glides from box to box, each receiving its
proper letter. This process is
repeated until the <span class="xxpn" id="p034">{p34}</span>
types which composed the form are all, apparently,
returned to the compartments whence they were
taken.</p>

<p>Suppose, however, that when ready to distribute
“feasible,” his attention is drawn momentarily to a
neighbor who desires his opinion as to a blotted word
in his take, and that, on returning to his work of distributing,
he imagines, or seems to remember, that
the word in hand is “fencible,”—the “a” goes into
the “n” box, and the “s” finds itself at “c.” By
and by, in setting type from this same case, the compositor
picks up the letters for “emancipate.” If he
happens to take up the two <i>wrong</i> letters consecutively
from the <i>right</i> boxes, his proof-sheet—unless
he reads and corrects the matter in his stick—will
present the word “ema<i>a</i>sipate”—which the proof-reader
will mark, for the compositor to correct.</p>

<p>Or it may happen in distributing, that the “f” and
“e” cohere, and are both dropped into the “f” box.
If the compositor’s mind is not intent on the matter
in hand, the error may not be noticed at once; in
which case the “a” gets into the “e” box, and some
or all the other letters of the word go wrong. The
error must be discovered when the last letter is
reached; but to search for each misplaced type until
it is found, would probably take more time than
would be required to correct the errors which must
otherwise appear in the proof.</p>

<p>But it is not in distributing only, that blunders
occur. There are many other sources of error, and
will be so long as present methods
continue in vogue. <span class="xxpn" id="p035">{p35}</span>
The only wonder is, that so few errors escape detection
before the printer’s work is handed over to the
reading public. We have by us an octavo Shakspeare,
each page of type from which it was printed,
having contained, as can be demonstrated, over six
thousand pieces of metal, the misplacing of any one
of which would have caused a blunder.</p>

<p>But the detection and marking of wrong letters
forms a comparatively small part of a proof-reader’s
duty. He must be able to tell at sight whether a
lead is too thick or too thin, and to discriminate
between a three-em space and a four-em space.
Many other important matters fall within his province,—and
these we shall endeavor to point out
before closing the present chapter.</p>

<p>Other things being equal, printers make the best
proof-readers. We have known two or three remarkably
skillful readers, whose work could not be surpassed,
who never imposed a form, nor set a line of
type. These, however, were rare exceptions.</p>

<p>A practical printer who never heard of the
digamma, and who has never read anything but
newspapers, will generally make a better proof-reader
than an educated man who is not practically
acquainted with the typographic art; for the printer
has, year in and year out, had a daily drill which
makes him skillful in orthography, and he has been
compelled to give close attention to the grammatical
points. Further, his dealing with individual types
enables him to see, without searching, errors which
men far more learned than he,
do not readily <span class="xxpn" id="p036">{p36}</span>
perceive; and his pen pounces on a wrong letter as
instinctively and unerringly as the bird darts on its
insect prey.</p>

<p>Sterne has uttered a sneer at the husk and shell of
learning; but the best bread is made from the whole
meal, and includes the “shorts” and the “middlings”
as well as the fine flour. If every lawyer, physician,
and clergyman were to spend six months at the
“case” before entering upon his profession, he
would find, even in that short term of labor, a
useful fitting and preparation for such literary tasks
as may afterward devolve upon him.</p>

<p>Nearly all manuscript copy is indebted to the compositor
and proof-reader for the proper punctuation;
and many errors in spelling, made by men who probably
know better, but write hastily, are silently corrected
in the printing-office. Contradictions, errors
of fact, anachronisms, imperfect sentences, solecisms,
barbarisms, are modestly pointed out to the author
by the proof-reader’s “quære,” or by a carefully
worded suggestion; and, most usually, the proof is
returned without comment,—and none is needed,—corrected
according to the proof-reader’s intimations.
Dickens, and a few other writers of eminence, have
acknowledged their indebtedness in such cases; but
we know one proof-reader—whose experience embraces
an infinite variety of subjects from bill-heads
to Bibles—who can remember but three cases in
which his assistance, whether valuable or otherwise,
was alluded to in a kindly manner. On the other
hand, the correction in the
proof is sometimes <span class="xxpn" id="p037">{p37}</span>
accompanied by some testy remark: as, “Does this suit
you?” or, “Will it do <i>now</i>?” The proof-reader is,
however, or should be, perfectly callous to all captious
criticisms and foolish comments; he need care
nothing for “harshness” or other nonsense, provided
his work is well and thoroughly done. Let no nervous
or touchy man meddle with proof-reading.</p>

<p>For the especial benefit of our non-professional
readers, we will here point out the usual routine in
regard to proofs. The editor or publisher of a book
or periodical sends to the printer such portions of
reading-matter or manuscript as he can, from time to
time, conveniently supply. This copy is passed to a
head-workman, who divides it into a number of parts,
called “takes,” each part being a suitable quantity
for a compositor to <i>take</i> at one time; and the name
of each compositor is penciled at the top of his take.
The type when set up is called “matter.”</p>

<p>When there is enough matter to fill a “galley”
(a metallic or wooden casing about two feet in
length), an impression, or “proof,” is taken on a
strip of paper wide enough to receive in the margin
the correction of such errors as may be found. This
proof, with the corresponding copy, is carried to the
proof-reader’s desk for examination and correction.</p>

<p>The reader will have at hand a copy of such directions
as may have been furnished by author, editor,
or publisher, to which he appends, from time to time,
memoranda of all eccentricities of orthography and
cap­i­tal­i­za­tion,—in short, all peculiarities of style, as
they arise. This he
consults frequently while <span class="xxpn" id="p038">{p38}</span>
reading the proof-sheet, and, for obvious reasons, with
especial attention after any unusual delay in the
progress of the work. Directions and notes as to
captions, sizes of type, form of tables, etc., are of
utility, especially when several readers are employed
on the same publication; but directions can scarcely
be framed so as to ensure&#x2060;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn3" id="fnanc3">[3]</a>
uniformity, except in few
particulars. We subjoin two or three samples of directions
and memoranda: our remarks in brackets.</p>

<h3 class="h3a">MEMORANDA FOR PROOF-READERS.</h3>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>The form is regular octavo.</p>

<p>Text is long primer, single leaded.</p>

<p>Tables and lists, having rules and boxheads, nonpareil solid.</p>

<p>Headings of tables and lists, brevier italic, lower case.</p>

<p>There are no numbered chapters. The heading of each section,
which takes the place of chapter heading, is pica light-face
celtic caps, spaced.</p>

<p>Geological ages and epochs are capitalized; for example,
<span class="spwdspb">“Devonian,” “Trias,” “sub-Carboniferous”</span>
v. [page <a href="#p176" title="to &#x70;age 176">176</a>.]</p>

<p>Quoted extracts in regular text type (long primer), between

<p>Capitalize “the <span class="spwdspb">West,” “the</span> South,” etc., but not “western
New <span class="spwdspb">York,” “central</span> Pennsylvania,” etc.</p>

<p>Do not use “&amp;c.” for “etc.”</p>

<p><span class="spwdspb">“Prof.,” “Gen.,”</span>
etc., preceding initials or Christian name; <span

etc.</p>

<p>Full point after roman numerals.</p>

<p>“Saint Louis,” etc.; spell out “Saint.”</p>

<p>Names of periodicals, in italics.</p>

<p>Names of books, roman, in quotation marks.</p>

<p>“Panther creek”; but “Panther Creek district.” That is,
capitalize titles.

<p>The following sample relates to an octavo on
Fishes:</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>Make “cod fishery” two words.</p>

<p><span class="spwdspb">“Offshore,” “Inshore”</span> [no hyphen].</p>

<p>“Sheepshead” [name of fish. Webster inserts an apostrophe
and a hyphen,—“Sheep’s-head”].</p>

<p>“Herring fisheries” [no hyphen].</p>

<p>“Herring-nets” [insert hyphen].</p></div>

<p>From a quarto on Fishes:</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>“Cod-fisherman” [hyphen].</p>

<p>“Cod fishery” [two words].</p></div>

<p>Engineer work:</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>Make footnotes of the “Remarks” column.</p>

<p>For “D. D.” in copy, spell “dry-dock.”</p>

<p>Use figures in all cases, for weights, distances, etc.</p></div>

<p>The following was for a Digest—Decisions:</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>Spell <span class="spwdspb">“travelling,” “employee,”</span> and divide “ser-vice.”
[“Travelling” and “ser-vice” are Worcester style. Webster
divides “serv-ice.”—In regard to “employee,” neither Webster
nor Worcester gives it place; but, instead, the French
“employé.” Webster has this note following the French
word: “The English form of this word, viz., <i>employee</i>,
though perfectly conformable to analogy, and therefore perfectly
legitimate, is not sanctioned by the usage of good
writers.” Since Webster’s note was written, some good
writers, as in the book of Decisions above mentioned, have
used the English word, as many printing-office employees can
testify,—and “<i>employé</i>” may as well be sent home, according
to the immigration laws, as unable to sustain itself in this
country.&#x2060;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn4" id="fnanc4">[4]</a>]</p></div>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfnfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc4" id="fn4">4</a>
Since the above remark was written, we have found “employee”
admitted as a correct English word, in Worcester’s “Supplement.”</p></div>

<p>Weather Reports:</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>The “upper Missouri valley” [small <i>v</i>].</p>

<p>The “Mississippi river” [small <i>r</i>].</p></div>

<p>The proof-reader knows, that (as we have already
remarked) every printing-office has a style of its
own; that, if left to itself, its style would be practically
uniform and always respectable,—and he soon
learns that some writers for the press have very firm
opinions about matters of little or no consequence,
and are very tenacious, if not pugnacious, in preferring
<i>tweedledee</i> to <i>tweedledum</i>; not because it is written
with more <i>e’s</i>, but because it is more correct—in
their opinion. However great may be a reader’s
capacity for memorizing trifling details, it is next to
impossible to keep minute verbal differences on different
mental shelves. After the big book is bound,
one will be likely to find a mingling of styles; the
big River of one page becomes a little river on the
next; “Pittsburg” here, reads “Pittsburgh” there;
and the dignified “National Park” of the first chapter
will dwindle to a mere “national park” in chapter
the twelfth.</p>

<p>If not hurried by a press of work, as may sometimes
be the case, the reader will first glance at the
proof as a whole. A variation in the thickness of
the leads, or a wrong indention, will, in this <i>tout-ensemble</i>
survey, very quickly catch his eye. Then,
still supposing he has time, he will read the galley
through silently, correcting errors in spelling; marking
turned or inverted
letters; improving the <span class="xxpn" id="p041">{p41}</span>
spacing, the punctuation; noting whether the heads and
subheads are in the required type; whether the
cap­i­tal­i­za­tion is uniform; whether—if the “slip”
beneath his eye happen to be near the end of a
large volume—the word “ourang-outang” which
he now meets with, was not printed somewhere in
the earlier part of the work as “orang-outang,” or, in
fact, whether, after some questioning, it finally went
to press as “orang-utan,”—which word he must
now, to preserve uniformity, hunt for and find among
his old proofs, if, peradventure, author or publisher,
or other person, have not borrowed them “for a few
minutes,”—alas! never to be returned.</p>

<p>Having settled this, and all similar cases and other
doubtful matters, he hands the copy to an assistant,
called a “copy-holder,” whose duty it is to read the
copy aloud, while he himself keeps his eye on the
print (but in newspaper offices, for the sake of
greater celerity, the proof-reader often reads aloud,
while the copy-holder follows him silently, intent on
the copy: interrupting, however, whenever any discrepancy
is observed). If the reader desire the copy-holder
to pause while he makes a correction, he repeats
the word where he wishes the reading to stop;
when ready to proceed he again pronounces the same
word, and the copy-holder reads on from that place.</p>

<p>The manner of marking, in the text, all errors
noticed, is shown, <i>infra</i>, in the “Specimen of First
Proof.” The corrections to be made are indicated,
in the margin, by appropriate words or characters
from “Marks used
in correcting Proofs”—also <span class="xxpn" id="p042">{p42}</span>
inserted below. Writers for the press who themselves
examine proof-sheets of their works, should
familiarize themselves with proof-reading technics.
An author who received for the first time some
proof-sheets returned them “clean”—apparently having
detected no errors. He was afterward disgusted
on finding it necessary to print a leaf of “errata,”
and complained that his corrections had been entirely
disregarded. On re-examining the proofs he had
returned, it was found that he <i>had</i> corrected—with
knife as well as pen. Where a comma was wanting,
he had used the pen, carefully and skillfully imitating
the printed character; and to convert semicolons
into commas he had brought the knife into play,—nicely
scratching out the superfluous part of the point.</p>

<p>Sometimes a line, or it may be several lines, of
type are by some mishap out of perpendicular—slanting;
so that only one side of each letter-face
shows a full impression on the proof. It is usual
in such case to draw several slanting marks across
the faulty line or lines, and make similar marks in
the margin. It is quite common, also, for readers to
insert in the margin the words “off its feet,”—that
being the printing-office designation for sloping matter.
One reader abandoned writing these words, for
two reasons: the first, that a compositor, when correcting,
inserted them in the text, making an astonishing
sentence; the second, that the marked passage,—a
piece of close, logical reasoning,—after being
carefully scanned by the author, was brought to the
reader, with a very earnest request
that he would <span class="xxpn" id="p043">{p43}</span>
point out what justice there was in that bluff remark.
It is enough to draw what beginners in writing call
“straight marks” across the matter, and also in the
margin. We append <span class="nowrap">other—</span></p>

<p>The above is very bad, even for a first proof,—but
we have seen worse, and have, perhaps, ourself
been responsible for some not much better. While
the copy-holder is reading aloud the
copy from which <span class="xxpn" id="p045">{p45}</span>
the above was set up, the reader is busy marking
errors, and making such characters in the margin as
will inform the compositors what is to be done to
make their work correct. At the conclusion of the
reading, the proof will present an appearance somewhat
like this <span class="nowrap">corrected—</span></p>

<p>If the proof in hand be a reprint, and the new edition
is to conform to the old, the copy-holder, while
reading, pronounces aloud the
points, capitals, etc., <span class="xxpn" id="p046">{p46}</span>
as they occur in the copy—saving labor and time by
using well-understood ab­bre­vi­a­tions. Take, for instance,
the second stanza of Tennyson’s “Voyage”:</p>

<div class="dpoemfarlft fsz6"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Warm
 broke the breeze against the brow,</div>
<div class="dpp01">Dry sang the tackle, sang the sail:</div>
<div class="dpp00">The Lady’s-head upon the prow</div>
<div class="dpp01">Caught the shrill salt, and sheer’d the gale.</div>
<div class="dpp00">The broad seas swell’d to meet the keel,</div>
<div class="dpp01">And swept behind: so quick the run,</div>
<div class="dpp00">We felt the good ship shake and reel,</div>
<div class="dpp01">We seem’d to sail into the Sun!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>This stanza the copy-holder reads thus:</p>

<div class="dpoemfarlft fsz6"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpp00"><i>Quote</i> “Warm broke the breeze against the brow, (<i>com.</i>)</div>
<div class="dpp01">Dry sang the tackle, (<i>com.</i>) sang the sail: (<i>colon.</i>)</div>
<div class="dpp00">The Lady’s-(<i>cap. pos. s</i>, <i>hyphen.</i>)head upon the prow</div>
<div class="dpp01">Caught the shrill salt, (<i>com.</i>) and sheer’(<i>pos.</i>)d the gale. (<i>full point.</i>)</div>
<div class="dpp00">The broad seas swell’(<i>pos.</i>)d to meet the keel, (<i>com.</i>)</div>
<div class="dpp01">And swept behind: (<i>colon.</i>) so quick the run, (<i>com.</i>)</div>
<div class="dpp00">We felt the good ship shake and reel, (<i>com.</i>)</div>
<div class="dpp01">We seem’(<i>pos.</i>)d to sail into the Sun!” (<i>cap. exclam. close of quote.</i>)</div>
</div></div>

<p>If the work extend beyond a single galley, the
slips of proof are marked in regular sequence, A, B,
C, etc., or 1, 2, 3, etc. Each slip is marked at top
“First Proof”: the names of the compositors, which
have been inscribed on their “takes,” are duly transferred
to the printed proof, which, with the errors
plainly noted thereon, is then given for correction to
the same persons who set up the matter. Their duty
having been attended to, a “second
proof” is taken: <span class="xxpn" id="p047">{p47}</span>
this the reader compares carefully with the first, to
ascertain whether the requisite changes of type have
been properly made; whether “doublets” have been
taken out, and “outs” put in. If any mark has
escaped the notice of the compositors, it is transferred
to the second proof. Close attention should
be given to this process of “revising”; it is not
enough to see that a wrong letter has been taken out,
and a right one put in; in the line where a change
has been made, all the words should be compared,
and also the line above and the line below a correction,—since
in correcting an error among movable
types, some of the types may move when they ought
not, and get misplaced.</p>

<p>As what escapes the notice of one observer may
be perceived by another, this second proof is again
“read by copy” by another proof-reader and assistant,
and a second time corrected and revised. The
“third proof” is now sent to the author, editor, or
publisher, with so much copy as may cover it, the
copy-holder being careful, however, to retain the
“mark-off”; <i>i. e.</i>, the sheet on which is marked off
the place where the next “first proof” is to begin.
But when the work is of such sort as not to require
extraordinary care, the second proof is sent out, a
single reading by copy being deemed sufficient. If
the work is read twice by copy, only one reader
should attend to the punctuation.</p>

<p>If, now, the copy have been hastily or carelessly
prepared, or if the author have gained new light
since he prepared it, the outside
party having charge <span class="xxpn" id="p048">{p48}</span>
of the work (whom, for convenience, we will designate
as the “author”) will return his proofs, full of
erasures, additions, alterations, interlineations, and
transpositions. With these the original compositors
have no concern; the changes required are made
by “the office,” and the time is charged to the person
who contracted for the printing of the work.</p>

<p>A second, third, or even more consecutive revises
of the same slip are sometimes sent to the author, to
the intent that he may see for himself that his corrections
have been duly made, and to allow him further
opportunity to introduce such alterations as to him
may seem desirable. Usually, however, the work,
after the correction of the author’s first proof, is
made up into pages; and when there are enough
of these for a “signature” or form of octavo, duodecimo,
or whatever the number of pages on the
sheet may be, the proof-reader revises these pages
by the author’s latest returned proof, cuts off the
slip at the line where the last page ends, and sends
the folded leaves, labeled <span class="spwdspb">“Second,” “Third,”</span> or
“Fourth” proof, as the case may be, together with
the corresponding slips of the next previous proof, to
the author, as before. The portion of slip proof
remaining—termed the “make-up”—should be
inscribed with the proper page, and the letter or
figure which is to be the signature of the next sheet,
and given, for his guidance, to the person who makes
up the work; to be returned again to the proof-reader,
with the other slip proofs of the next sheet
of made-up pages, when that is
ready for revision. <span class="xxpn" id="p049">{p49}</span></p>

<p>The author may be desirous of seeing a fifth, sixth,
or, as the algebraists say, any number, <i>n</i>, of proofs.
When he expresses himself as satisfied with his share
of the correcting, the last author’s proof is corrected,
a “revise” taken, and the proof-reader gives this last
revise a final reading for the press. As any errors
which escape detection now, will show themselves in
the book, this last reading should be careful, deliberate,
and painstaking. See to it, my young beginner,
that the “signature” is the letter or number next in
sequence to that on your previous press-proof. See
to it, that the first page of the sheet in hand connects
in reading with the last page of the previous one,
and that the figures denoting the page form the next
cardinal number to that which you last sent to press.
Having done this, examine the “folios” (the “pagination,”
as some say) throughout; read the running
titles; if there be a new chapter commenced, look
back in your previous proofs to make sure that said
new chapter is <span class="nowrap">“<span class="smmaj">XIX.</span>,”</span>
and not <span class="nowrap">“<span class="smmaj">XVIII.</span>”;</span>
see that
the head-lines of the chapter are of the right size,
and in the right font of type; for, if the “minion”
case happened to be covered up, the compositor may
have forgotten himself, and set them up in “brevier”;
if there is rule-work, see that the rules come
together properly, and are right side up; if there is
Federal money, see that the “$” is put at the beginning
of the number following a
rule,&#x2060;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn5" id="fnanc5">[5]</a>
and of the
number in the top line of every page;
if points are <span class="xxpn" id="p050">{p50}</span>
used as “leaders,” see that there are no commas or
hyphens among them. If the style require a comma
before leaders, see that none have been left out; if
the style reject a comma, see that none have been
left in; in short, see to everything,—and then, on
the corner of the sheet, write the word “Press” as
boldly as you can, but with the moral certainty that
some skulking blunder of author, compositor, or corrector
has eluded all your watchfulness.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfnfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc5"
id="fn5">5</a> In the Government Printing Office the
style omits the “$” in this case,—the sign at top of
table or page being considered sufficient.</p></div>

<p>The errors made by ourselves are those which
occasion us the most pain. Therefore be chary of
changing anything in the author’s last proof. If a
sentence seem obscure, see whether the insertion of
a comma will make it clear. If you find “patonce,”
do not change it to “potence,” unless, from your
knowledge of heraldry, you are aware of a good
reason for such an alteration. If you find <i>pro. ami</i>,
look in the dictionary before striking out the point
after <i>pro.</i>; peradventure it is a contraction. If,
finally, after puzzling over some intricate sentence,
you can make nothing of it, let it console you
that the following paragraph appears in Hävernick:
“Accordingly it is only from this passage that a conclusion
can be drawn as to the historical condition
of the people, which is confirmed also by notices elsewhere”;
and let it content you to say, in the words
of Colenso, “I am at a loss to understand the meaning
of the above paragraph.” So let the obscure
passage remain.</p>

<p>Still, however, should you find some gross error of
dates, some obvious solecism, or
some wrong footing <span class="xxpn" id="p051">{p51}</span>
in a column of figures, and find yourself unable to
change the reading with absolute certainty of being
right, this proof, which you had hoped would be a final
one, must be returned to the author with the proper
quære. When it comes back to your sanctum, you
may perhaps be pleased at finding on the margin a few
words complimentary of your carefulness; or perhaps a
question couched in this encomiastic style: “Why
did not your stupid proof-reader find this out before?”</p>

<p>Whether reading first or final proofs of Records of
Court, you should not change the spelling of words,
nor supply omissions, nor strike out a repeated word
or words; for the printed record is assumed to be an
exact transcript of what is written, and there should
be no alterations,—neither uniformity nor correctness
is to be sought at the expense of departing from
copy. Inserting the necessary points where these
have been neglected, is not considered a change of
the record,—as, for instance, an in­ter­ro­ga­tion point
after a direct question to a witness; for, as “the
punctuation is no part of the law,” <i>a fortiori</i> it is no
part of the record. If the caption be “Deposition
of John Prat,” and the signature be “John Pratt,”
and if in another place you find the same individual
designated as “John Pradt,” there is no help for it.
You have no authority to alter the record, and must
print it as it stands. So, too, in regard to dates. If
you read “1st Feb. 1889” on one page, “Feb. 1,
1889” on another, so let them stand—the change of
style is a trifle; and, if it be a fault, it is the fault
of the record, and not yours. <span class="xxpn" id="p052">{p52}</span></p>

<p>And here let us say a word about this matter of
uniformity: very important in some works, in others
it is of no consequence whatever, however much some
readers may stickle for it. If, for example, a mass of
letters, from all parts of the country, recommending
a patent inkstand, or stating the prospects of the
potato crop, are sent in to be printed, the dates and
addresses will vary in style, according to the taste
and knowledge of the several writers; and there is
not the slightest need of changing them to make
them alike, as if all these widely scattered writers
had graduated from the same school. Let such writings
be printed as diversely as they come to hand.
If one writes <i>plough</i>, and another <i>plow</i>, what matters
it, so far as your proof-reading is concerned? If one
writes “15th June,” and another “June 15” or
“June 15th,” so let it stand on the printed page. It
is idle to waste time in making things alike, that
could not by any possibility have been written alike.
But you can make each letter consistent with itself,
which is all that uniformity requires. You need not
stretch one man out, and cut off the feet of another,
to justify all authors in your composing-stick. So
much for exceptional cases.</p>

<p>As a general rule, study to preserve uniformity in
every work. If “A. M.” and “P. M.” are in capitals
on one page, it will look very like carelessness
to have them appear
<span class="nowrap">“<span class="smmaj">A.M.</span>”</span> and
<span class="nowrap">“<span class="smmaj">P.M.</span>”</span> in small
capitals, on the next. With the exceptions above
pointed out, your only safety is to have but one style,
and to adhere to it with the stiffness
of a martinet, <span class="xxpn" id="p053">{p53}</span>
in all contingencies, unless overruled by those who
have a right to dictate in the premises.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 class="h3a">READING GREEK.</h3>

<p>Greek words sometimes appear in copy, and are
somewhat vexatious to printers who never had the
good fortune to study Greek at school—or elsewhere.
In a proof-sheet, we once met a word whose
etymology was given thus in the copy: “From Ἕλιος
the sun, and φιλος a lover” (the <i>epsilon</i> was the
author’s mistake). The compositor, not aware of a
Greek alphabet, set up the passage in those English
letters which most nearly resemble the Hellenic
characters, and it appeared in this guise: “From
Ediog the sun, and pidog a lover.” We advise
proof-readers, and compositors and copy-holders as
well, to acquire—if they do not already possess—so
much knowledge of Greek letters and characters
as will enable them to acquit themselves without
discredit, though “Ediog” and “pidog” condog
(<i>v.</i> Wb.) to annoy them. A few hours’ attention to
the alphabet and characters given below, and to the
annexed practical directions, will suffice to fix in the
memory as much knowledge of Greek as will serve
for the mechanical following of the copy,—mechanical
following,—for, if you are setting up or reading
a reprint of the 450th page of Webster’s Dictionary,
and meet with the word ἐννενήκοντα you must put in
the eleven letters as they stand: and if copying
Worcester’s 486th page, you find ἐννεήκοντα, put in
<span class="xxpn" id="p054">{p54}</span>
the ten letters. If you have any doubts, submit
your query.</p>

<p>The Greek alphabet consists of twenty-four letters.</p>

<p>In reading Greek, mention each letter by its English
equivalent.</p>

<p class="padtopc">Ε is read, “cap.
short e”; ε, “short e”; Η is read, “cap. long e”; η,
“long e.”</p>

<p>Ο is read,
“cap. short o”; ο, “short o”; Ω is read, “cap.
long o”; ω, “long o.” <span class="xxpn"
id="p055">{p55}</span></p>

<p>There are three accents,—the
acute <span class="nowrap">(&#x2006;΄&#x2006;),</span> the
grave <span class="nowrap">(&#x2006;<img class="iglyphc" src="images/u1fef.png"
 width="21" height="79" alt="&#x1fef;" />&#x2006;),</span> and the
circumflex <span class="nowrap">(&#x2006;<img class="iglyphc" src="images/u1fc0.png"
 width="29" height="79" alt="&#x1fc0;" />&#x2006;).</span></p>

<p>ύ is read, “acute u”; ὶ is read, “grave i”; ᾶ is
read, “circumflex a.”</p>

<p class="padtopc">Over every vowel or diphthong beginning a word
is placed one of two characters, called breathings,
which, for the purpose of reading, we may designate
as the
smooth <span class="nowrap">(&#x2006;᾿&#x2006;)</span> and the
rough <span class="nowrap">(&#x2006;῾&#x2006;).</span></p>

<p>ἀ is read, “smooth a”; ἱ is read, “rough i.”</p>

<p class="padtopc">When two marks appear over a letter, both should
be mentioned by the copy-holder.</p>

<p>ὔ is read, “smooth, acute u”; ὅ is read, “rough,
acute, short o”; ὃ, “rough, grave, short o”; ὦ, “circumflex,
smooth, long o.”</p>

<p class="padtopc">The compositor and proof-reader
should be careful that accented letters are used
according to the copy, as in many cases the difference
of accentuation serves also to mark the difference of
signification. Thus, νέος signifies <i>new</i>; νεὸς, <i>a
field</i>: ἴον, <i>a violet</i>; ἰὸν, <i>going</i>.</p>

<p>ᾳ, ῃ, ῳ, are diphthongs; their second vowel (ι), being
silent, is placed underneath, or subscribed. These
should be read thus: ᾳ, “a, subscript”; ῃ, “long e,
subscript”; ῳ, “long o, subscript.”</p>

<p class="padtopc">In Greek, only four points or stops are used: the
comma (,); the note of in­ter­ro­ga­tion (;); the colon,
or point at top (·); and the full stop (.). These
should be mentioned
as they occur. <span class="xxpn" id="p056">{p56}</span></p>

<p>The method of reading will, we think, be sufficiently
exemplified if we give but one line. We
select the third, which should be read by the copy-holder,
as follows:</p>

<p>Cap. K, a, grave i; t, acute u, m, b, long o subscript;
k, r, long e, p, circumflex i, d, a; p, short e,
r, acute i, g, r, a, ph, short e; cap. P, short e, r, s, i,
k, grave short o, n; cap. smooth acute A, r, long e.</p>

<p class="padtopc">Words from dead and foreign languages, introduced
into English text, are printed in italics, until, being
frequently met, they cease to be strangers; then
printers and proof-readers anglicify them as much
as possible, by printing them in roman; but some
of these retain certain accents which indicate their
alien origin. The Spanish <i>cañon</i> is completely anglicized
into “canyon” (<i>o</i> as in <i>no</i>); our miners write
“arrastra” in roman, although the term has not yet
found its way into our most popular dictionaries; our
dreadful accident-makers have set afloat so many
“canards,” that that word has become better English
than French; “papier-mache” usually appears
in roman without the accent on the
final <i>e</i>; <i>employé</i> <span class="xxpn" id="p057">{p57}</span>
has become a good “employee” in our workshops;
and at an early day, every “protégé” and “protégée,”
already roman, will throw off the foreign accents, and
remain none the less acute “protegees”; <span class="spwdspb">“éclat,”
“régime,”</span> and “résumé” still cling to their acute <i>e’s</i>.
Many words and phrases are hesitating whether to
remain foreigners, or to become naturalized. They
have “taken out their first papers,” as it were, having
at times appeared in English garb.</p>

<p>It would be vastly convenient for every compositor
and proof-reader (every author, of course, reads proof)
to have at hand two lists of such Latin and foreign
words as most frequently occur in books, magazines,
and newspapers,—the one containing the words to
be set up in italics, the other, words to “go in
roman,” as the phrase is. We append two such
lists, as samples rather than as fixities to be followed,
although they represent very nearly, if not
exactly, the present status of the class of words we
are considering. The roman list is destined to be
continually lengthening, while the italic, save as it
receives new accretions from foreign sources, must
be correspondingly diminishing.</p>

<div class="section" id="p059">
<h2 class="h2herein">CHAPTER III.
<span class="hsmall">
STYLE.</span></h2>

<p class="pfirst">Before beginning to read proof, a man usually
prepares himself by learning how to make the technical
marks used in correcting; he then reads a
chapter on the use of capitals; takes up a grammar,
and reviews the rules of punctuation; and by reading,
and conversing with readers, gets such helps as
give him a good degree of confidence. But at the
very threshold of his duties he is met by a little
“dwarfish demon” called “Style,” who addresses
him somewhat after this fashion: “As you see me
now, so I have appeared ever since the first type was
set in this office. Everything here must be done as
I say. You may mark as you please, but don’t violate
the commands of Style. I may seem to disappear
for a time, when there is a great rush of work,
and you may perhaps bring yourself to believe that
Style is dead. But do not deceive yourself,—Style
never dies. When everything is going merrily, and
you are rejoicing at carrying out some pet plan of
your own, you will find me back again, tearing the
forms to pieces, and again asserting my irrevocable
authority. Stick to my orders, and all will be well.
Don’t tell me of grammarians or lex­i­cog­raphers;
say nothing of better ways,
or improvements or <span class="xxpn" id="p060">{p60}</span>
progress. I am Style, and my laws are like those of
the Medes and Persians.” And Style states his true
character.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the proof-reader, Style seldom
writes his laws; or, if at any time written, their visible
form presently perishes, and they can only be
got at, as one may learn the common law of England,
through past decisions. You, my young friend, may
in vain consult old proofs; works formerly read, at
the desk you now occupy, by some vanished predecessor.
Your searching cannot help you much; for
authors being without the jurisdiction, are independent
of the authority, of Style,—they may allow
him to dominate over their works, or they may not.
How, then, are you to distinguish, and select as
models, those which were read under the direct supervision
of Style? In the course of a few years you
may come to know a portion of his laws; but the
whole code is past finding out.</p>

<p>To drop the personification, every office has a style—an
arrangement of details—peculiar to itself. In
one, “Government” is spelled with a capital; in a
second, “government” is spelled with a lower-case
“g”; in this office, the four seasons are always
“Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter”; in that,
they are “spring, summer,” etc., having capitals only
when personified: and so of a thousand other cases
in cap­i­tal­i­za­tion. In this office, before a quoted
extract we put a colon and dash, thus:—while, in
the office across the way, the style is to put a colon
only: and, a little farther on, is an
office which uses <span class="xxpn" id="p061">{p61}</span>
only the dash—yet a fourth, round the corner, puts
a comma and dash, thus,—while a fifth undertakes
to use all these and even additional methods, as the
period, the semicolon, and dash, selecting as the sense
or convenience or caprice may dictate.&#x2060;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn6" id="fnanc6">[6]</a>
Here, the
style requires a comma before <i>and</i>, in “pounds, shillings,
and pence”; there, the style is “pounds, shillings
and <span class="spwdspb">pence.” “Viz,”</span> in Mr. A.’s office, is
considered a contraction, and is printed “viz.”—with
the period; in Mr. B.’s office, it is not a contraction,
and the period is not used; in Mr. C.’s office,
“viz” is put entirely under the ban, and compositors
and proof-readers are directed to substitute for it the
word “namely,” in all cases. As regards orthography,
two styles—the Worcester and Webster—have,
in almost all offices, alternate sway; and—which
complicates matters still more—everywhere
there is an “office style.” Each “rules a moment;
chaos umpire sits,” etc.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfnfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc6" id="fn6">6</a>
For some varieties of style in introducing quotations, see
“Historical Memorials of Westminster Abbey. By Arthur Penrhyn Stanley,
D.D. London: John Murray, 1868”; especially pp. 256, 257.</p></div>

<p>Suppose half-a-dozen works going through the
press at the same time, embracing three styles of
orthography, and four or five styles in cap­i­tal­i­za­tion;
one style which requires turned commas at the beginning
only, of a quotation, and one which requires
them at the beginning of every line of an extract,—you
see at once that a proof-reader, so beset, must
needs have his wits about him. For, notice, the
first “slip” which comes to hand is in
the “Life of <span class="xxpn" id="p062">{p62}</span>
John Smith”; this is in the Worcester style, and
requires “traveller” and “jeweller” to be spelled
each with two
<span class="nowrap"><i>l</i>’s,</span> and “impanelled” with two
<span class="nowrap"><i>l</i>’s.</span> The
next galley-proof to be read is part of the “Life of
James Smith”; this is in the Webster style; and
now the reader must change front, and see to it that
he spells “traveler” and “jeweler” with one <i>l</i> each,
and “impaneled” with one <i>l</i>. Now as these works
are in the same size of type, and are very similar in
appearance, it would not be strange if now and then
the styles were to “cross over”; but, observe, the
third slip, the “Life of William Smith,” is “office
style,” requiring “traveler” to be spelled with one <i>l</i>,
and “jeweller” with two (very absurd, but all styles
have something absurd and arbitrary in them), while
“empanel” now repudiates an initial <i>i</i>. Further, the
publishers of the “Life of John” desire to have it in
uniform style with their “watch-pocket series,” in
which names of ships were put between quotation-marks;
the author of the “Life of James” insists,
that, in his work, names of ships shall not be quoted,
and shall be set in roman; the “Life of William,” being
in office style, requires names of ships to be in italics.</p>

<p>Again, each of these works has, at the commencement
of its several chapters, a cast of initial letter
differing from the style of the other two,—the
first a two-line plain letter, the second a black
letter, the third an open-face letter; and still
further (there is no “finally”), the “Life of John”
has <span class="spwdspb">“backwards,” “forwards,”
“towards,”</span> all with the final <i>s</i>; and the
proof-reader has just received from the outside
reader <span class="xxpn" id="p063">{p63}</span> of
the “Life of James,” a sharp note, stating that he
has stricken the <i>s</i> from “towards,” as many as ten
times, and coolly assuring the said proof-reader
that there is no such word as “towards” in the
English language. Meanwhile, intermingled with
the above readings, are four Sunday-school books,
A, B, C, and D. A and B require the words <span
class="spwdspb">“everything,” “anything,”</span>
and “cannot” to be divided respectively into
two words,—“every <span class="spwdspb">thing,”
“any</span> <span class="spwdspb">thing,” “can</span>
not”; while C and D, with a general direction
to follow Webster, want these words printed in
the usual manner,—closed up. A and C must have
two words of “&#x202f;’t <span class="spwdspb">is,”
“it</span> <span class="spwdspb">’s,” “do</span>
<span class="spwdspb">n’t,” “could</span> <span
class="spwdspb">n’t,” “must</span> n’t”; B and D
require the same, with the exception of “don’t,” which
must be made one word. A and D want an apostrophe in
“won’t”; while B and C insist that the change from
“will not” is so great, that “wont” is virtually a new
word, wherefore they cannot conscientiously permit the
apostrophe.</p>

<p>Among these literary foolishnesses and idle discriminations,
are inter-readings of pamphlets on the
leather trade; the Swamptown Directory, the copy
being the pages of an old edition, pasted on broadsides
of paper, half the names stricken out, and new
ones inserted haphazard on the wide margin, their
places in the text indicated by lines crossing and recrossing
each other, and occasionally lost in a <i>plexus</i>
or ganglion; reports of the Panjandrum Grand
Slump Mining Company, the Glenmutchkin Railway
Company, and the new and
improved Brown Paper <span class="xxpn" id="p064">{p64}</span>
Roofing Company; Proceedings of the National
Wool-Pulling Association, and of the Society for
promoting the Introduction of Water-Gas for Culinary
and Illuminating Purposes; likewise auction-bills,
calendars, ball-cards, dunning-letters (some of
these to be returned through the post-office, the proof-reader’s
own feathers winging the shaft), glowing
descriptions of Dyes, Blackings, Polishes, and Varnishes;
in short, proofs of the endless variety of matters
which constitute the daily pabulum of a book and job
office,—and, in all these, style has its requirements.</p>

<p>If all this be borne in mind, it will not seem surprising,
especially when we reflect that all individuals
in their progress toward a perfect civilization
are not yet within sight of their goal,—it will not
seem surprising, if now and then an irate brother
should rush into the proof-reader’s presence, exclaiming,
“What do you mean, sir? I thought I knew
something, but it appears I don’t! Here you have
put ‘Hudson street’ with a little <i>s</i>, and ‘Hudson
River’ with a capital <i>R</i>: what sort of work do you
call that?” Should this occur, the schooled reader
has but to reply, “That, my dear sir, is the uniform
style of this office,—we <i>always</i> ‘put things’ as you
have stated,” and the questioner is satisfied, and
apologetically withdraws.</p>

<p>As no acknowledged literary Dictator has arisen
since Johnson (if we except Webster), and as we
have no good grounds to expect one, let us hope
there may be a convention of the learned men of the
United States, with full powers to
legislate upon, and <span class="xxpn" id="p065">{p65}</span>
finally settle, all questions of syntax, orthography,
punctuation, and style, and authorized to punish
literary dissenters, by banishment from the Republic
of Letters.</p>

<p>Were there a common and acknowledged authority
to which printer, publisher, proof-reader, and
author could appeal, the eye, the pen, and the press
would be relieved of much useless labor, and the
cost of books would be correspondingly reduced.
The Smithsonian Institution would confer a lasting
benefit on mankind by establishing a Board or Bureau
of scholars, which should publish a dictionary of
all English and Anglicized words, <i>without various
spellings</i>, and also such other words as might meet
the want long felt, and which was expressed in “The
Spectator,” so long ago as Aug. 4, 1711,—where
the author, having spoken of certain perplexities
which beset writers, adds: “[These] will never be
decided till we have something like an academy, that
by the best authorities and rules drawn from the
analogy of languages, shall settle all controversies
between grammar and idiom.” When such works from the
Smithsonian Institution shall have appeared, and
Congress shall have adopted them as standards to which
all Departmental work shall conform, the diversities
of spelling will disappear from the publications of
the Government. Those who would diffuse knowledge
among men should have sharp oversight of the vehicle
in which knowledge is to be conveyed,—to wit,
<span class="smcap">L<b>ANGUAGE</b>,</span>—“the
foundation for the whole faculty of
thinking.”</p></div><!--section-->

<div class="section" id="p066">
<h2 class="h2herein">CHAPTER IV.
<span class="hsmallleft">
GENERAL REMARKS: CON­TAIN­ING SOME IL­LUS­TRA­TIONS
OF, AND AD­DI­TIONS TO, THE SUB­JECT-MAT­TER
OF THE FORE­GOING THREE CHAP­TERS.</span></h2>

<p class="pfirst">If an author sends his manuscript
to the printing-office without any instructions or
directions as to cap­i­tal­i­za­tion, punctuation, etc.,
the printer will follow his own “office style,” and
the work will be, within certain limits, correctly
done; that is, with as near an approach to uniformity
as it is possible for ordinary fallible mortals to
attain. But if the manuscript be accompanied with
numerous “Directions” to the printer, some of these
will be forgotten or overlooked, or become mixed in
the minds of compositors and proof-readers with some
set of diametrically opposite “Directions,”—and so the
work will very likely abound in incongruities.</p>

<p>We have known two works to be in hand at the
same time, one with directions to “Capitalize freely,”
the other, to “Use capitals sparingly.” The “Directions”
are sometimes quite minute, almost microscopic;
still, it is the duty of the proof-reader to
follow them into the very extremities of their littleness.
One writer says, “Put up ‘eastern,’ ‘western,’
etc., in such cases as this: ‘The purple finch sometimes
passes the cold
season in Eastern <span class="xxpn" id="p067">{p67}</span>
Massachusetts, and even in Northern New Hampshire’”;
another directs, “Put compass-points down, as ‘In
northern Nevada.’” If the office style is “Hudson
and Connecticut Rivers,” a direction will be sent in
thus: “In all my work, print ‘Weber and Sevier
rivers,’ ‘Phalan’s and Johanna lakes’—not Lakes.”
One author wants “VIII-inch gun and 64-pounder”;
another looks upon this as numerically and typo­graph­i­cally
erroneous, and insists on an “8-inch gun
and a LXIV-pounder”; still another prefers arabic
figures throughout, and prints an “8-inch gun and 64-pounder”;
yet another likes best the first of the
above styles, but wishes a period placed after the
roman numerals, so it shall read, an “VIII.-inch
gun”; one more dislikes “double pointing,” and
would retain the period, but strike out the hyphen.
“In my novel, spell ‘Marquise De Gabriac’ with
a big D, and ‘Madame de Sparre’ with a little ‘d.’”</p>

<p>With hundreds of Reports and reports from Institutions
and institutions, from Departments and departments,
from Bureaus and bureaus, trials at law, equity
cases, interference cases, Revised Statutes, and thousands
of documents, all as anxious to attract the
public eye as ever Mr. Riddleberger was to catch
the Speaker’s, and rushing compositors and proof-readers
and steam-presses with a dizzying velocity
which almost prohibits nicety of execution, it were
far wiser for authors and copyists to attend carefully
to the legibility and accuracy of their manuscripts,
than to send to the printer blundering haphazard
pages, accompanied with
directions running counter <span class="xxpn" id="p068">{p68}</span>
to what the writers themselves have exhibited in
their manuscripts.</p>

<p>We recollect that a printer once received a manuscript
accompanied with minute directions, extending
even to syllabication. It was given out to the compositors,
and a rough manuscript it was; one found
in his take, “One Spanish Mc Krel” and “One
caperamber,”—as he and the others in his chapel
read the words,—conundrums which after hard
study of characteristics and comparison of letters
were, by an ingenious old typographic Champollion,
solved as “One Spanish mackerel” and “One café-au-lait.”</p>

<p>If Gunther’s “Catalogue of Fishes, British Museum”
is to be written, it is proper to abbreviate it
to “Gunther’s Cat. Fish., Brit. Mus.” An author
who undertook so to write it, jammed the Cat. close
to the Fish, and placed the first period above the
line. He should not have been surprised when he
read in his proof-sheet, “Gunther’s Cat-Fish., Brit.
Mus.”,—which, although apparently according to
copy, was not “according to Gunther.”</p>

<p>The use of commas and other pause-marks is to
bring out the sense, and when capitals will subserve
the same purpose it is well to use them also,—whether
one finds a printed Rule directing it or not.
Thus Stedman writes:</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>“In his verse, Emerson’s spiritual philosophy and laws of
conduct appear again, but transfigured. Always the idea of
Soul, central and pervading, of which Nature’s forms are but
the created symbols. As in his early
discourse he recognized <span class="xxpn" id="p069">{p69}</span>
two entities, Nature and the Soul, so to the last he believed
Art to be simply the union of Nature with man’s will—Thought
symbolizing itself by Nature’s aid.”</p></div>

<p>Names of States and Territories, when following
names of cities, towns, and post-offices, are usually
contracted; as:</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>Savannah, Ga.; Brunswick, Me.; San Diego, Cal.; New
Orleans, La.; Plymouth, Mass.</p></div>

<p>But in any other connection, names of States and
Territories are spelled in full; as:</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>Mendocino County, California. We crossed Nevada Territory.
We visited Luray Cave, Virginia.</p></div>

<p>In an office where the employees are accustomed
to the above rules, absolute uniformity would be
attainable, if it were not for the interference of specialists.
If, from such office, a book is issued in
which you find “Richmond, Virginia,” and, farther
on, “Richmond, Va.,” you may be sure that a
“direction” to “spell out, in all cases, names of
States and Territories” accompanied the manuscript;
that one reader, mindful, as it happened, of
the important direction, spelled “Virginia,” while
another, from force of habit, followed the office style,
and made no change from the customary “Va.”; and
you may further conclude, that the author of the
work, when examining the proof-sheets, had himself
become oblivious of the direction he had given.</p>

<p>We have known more than
forty special directions <span class="xxpn" id="p070">{p70}</span>
to be sent to a printing-office with the manuscript
copy of one book. An author may fancy that numerous
minute rulings will ensure uniformity and beauty
to his book; but the chances of discrepancy and mistake
are increased in direct ratio to the number of
such of his rulings as run counter to the office style.
His “more requires less,”
but produces “more.”</p>
</div><!--section-->

<div class="section" id="p071">
<h2 class="h2herein">CHAPTER V.
<span class="hsmall">
PUNCTUATION.</span></h2>

<p class="pfirst">Printers and proof-readers are to
take for granted, that, in every work which falls
under their supervision, the proper agreement between
thought and expression has been effected by the
author. He alone has the right to change the words
and their collocation; and, if fairly punctuated, the
manuscript should be closely followed, word for word,
and point for point.</p>

<p>Every person who writes for the press should
punctuate his work presentably; but—since the
majority of writers are inattentive to punctuation—custom
and convenience, if not necessity, have
thrown upon the compositor and proof-reader the
task of inserting in their proper places the grammatical
points, and such other points and marks as shall
assist a reader in obtaining a ready apprehension of
the author’s meaning. These are the period (.), the
colon (:), the semicolon (;), the comma (,), the
note of in­ter­ro­ga­tion (?), the note of exclamation
(!), the parenthesis (&#x202f;), and the dash (—).</p>

<p>Besides these principal characters, there are other
marks and signs used in writing and printing,—the
hyphen (‐), the apostrophe (’), and others; all
which may be found in the
concluding division of <span class="xxpn" id="p072">{p72}</span>
this chapter, numbered <span class="smmaj">VIII.,</span>
and should be referred
to as occasion may require.</p>

<p>Books which treat of English grammar speak of
four of the points in common use—to wit, the
period, the colon, the semicolon, and the comma—as
“grammatical” points; while the dash, the note of
in­ter­ro­ga­tion, the note of exclamation, and the parenthesis
are classified as “rhetorical,”—being used
to indicate various effects produced in conversation
by changes in the tone of the voice. But
as “English grammar is the art of speaking and
writing [or printing] the English language with propriety,”
and as all points and marks in the printer’s
case are necessary to printing with propriety, it is
not essential in this work to make the distinctions
alluded to above. Nor shall we treat at length, if at
all, of technical marks not in common use; as, for
instance, signs used in algebra and chemistry, and in
various arts and sciences. These can be referred
to, should occasion require, in handbooks, and in
Webster’s Dictionary, pp. 1864–68, or in Worcester’s,
pp. 1773–75.</p>

<p>Our school-books used to tell us, that at the period
we should stop long enough to count four; at the
colon, three; at the semicolon, two; at the comma,
one. But pauses vary in length, as readers and
speakers wish to affect or impress their hearers:
hence reporters of speeches and orations sometimes—finding
ordinary points and marks insufficient—insert,
in brackets, some comment indicating that
there was a pause made which
outreached the time <span class="xxpn" id="p073">{p73}</span>
allowed for an ordinary period. We listened in
April, 1861, to a speech by Wendell Phillips, in
which, at the close of one sentence, the orator paused
long enough to count ten or twelve; the reporters at
that place inserted in brackets the words “[An impressive
pause].”&#x2060;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn7" id="fnanc7">[7]</a>
To denote by distinctive characters
every possible length of pause would require an
infinitude of signs, types, and cases. We must therefore
do the best we can with the few points now in
use, leaving much to the taste of authors, printers,
and readers. Still, the immense advantage modern
students have over those of ancient times is made
obvious by a comparison of antique and modern
writings,—for punctuation is comparatively a modern
affair, whose origin and changes it will be both useful
and interesting to trace,—and in doing this, we shall
endeavor to avoid the charge of prolixity, by condensing
into brief space information gained from a
variety of sources.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfnfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc7" id="fn7">7</a>
“There is only one thing those cannon shot in the harbor of
Charleston settle,—that there never can be a compromise. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
During these long and weary weeks we have waited to hear the
Northern conscience assert its purpose. It comes at last. [An impressive
pause.] Massachusetts blood has consecrated the pavements
of Baltimore, and those stones are now too sacred to be trodden by
slaves.”</p></div>

<p>The most ancient Greek manuscript known is among
the papyri of the Louvre. It is a work on astronomy,
and is indorsed with deeds of 165 and 164 <span
class="smmaj">B.C.</span> This has “a certain sort
of separation of words.” In a copy of Homer, written
<span class="smmaj">B.C.,</span> a wedge-shaped sign
&gt; is inserted “between the beginnings of <span
class="xxpn" id="p074">{p74}</span> lines” to mark
a new passage. But even these marks were soon lost
sight of; subsequent Greek and Latin writing runs on
continuously without distinction of words. In the
fifth century of our era, the fourth verse of the
Second Epistle of John was thus written:</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>τεκνωνσουπεριπατουν</p>
<p>τασεναληθειακαθωσεντο</p>
<p>ληνελαβομεναποτουπρς
(The πρς a contraction for πατρος.)</p>
</div>

<p>In Greek MSS. this method continued until the
fourteenth century.</p>

<p>St. Jerome (<span class="smmaj">A.D.</span> 324–420) wrote a Latin version
of the Bible—“the foundation of the Vulgate”—“per
<i>cola</i> et <i>commata</i>”; not with colons and commas
as we understand those words, but by a stichometric
arrangement,—dividing the text into short sentences
or lines, according to the sense, chiefly with a view
to a better understanding of the meaning, and a
better delivery in public reading. It is not until the
latter part of the seventh century that there is some
separation of words in Latin MSS. In the later
Latin (eighth century) the full point in various positions
was introduced,—being placed on a level with
the top, bottom, or middle of the letters,—as the students
of “Andrews and Stoddard” are well aware.
In still later MSS. in small letter, the full point
on the line or high was first used; then
the comma and <span class="xxpn" id="p075">{p75}</span>
semicolon; and the inverted semicolon
<span class="nowrap">(<img class="iglyphc" src="images/u061b.png"
 width="24" height="80" alt="&#x061b;" />),</span> whose
power was stronger than the comma.</p>

<p>In early Irish and English MSS., separation of
words is quite consistently followed; and in these
the common mark of punctuation was the full point,
while to denote the final stop or period one or two
points with a comma (..,) were used.</p>

<p>Contractions were much used in ancient MSS. to
save time and labor. Some of these were denoted by
a semicolon&#x202f;; as b; =&nbsp;bus; q; =&nbsp;que; vi; =&nbsp;videlicet,—this
character, in cursive writing, readily became
a <i>z</i>, whence we have our viz =&nbsp;videlicet.</p>

<p>The Roman numerals in ancient texts were placed
between full points; e.g., .CXL., to prevent confusion.</p>

<p>Punctuation remained very uncertain until the end
of the fifteenth century, when the Manutii, three
generations of printers,—the elder (1450–1515) the
most learned, skillful, and energetic of the three,—increased
the number of points, and made rules for
their application; and these were so generally
adopted, that Aldus Manutius and his son and grandson
may be considered inventors of the present system
of punctuation, notwithstanding it has been
changed, and perhaps improved upon, since their
time,—notably in the use of the colon. But scholars
differ so widely in some respects as to the insertion
of commas, as well as other points, that not many
rules are as yet absolutely fixed.</p>

<p>Modern writers tell us that “points are used to
mark the <i>sense</i> rather than the
<i>pauses</i>.” We would <span class="xxpn" id="p076">{p76}</span>
substitute “as well as” for “rather.” In writing
from dictation we place points where the <i>dictator</i>
makes pauses; and in reading we make pauses where
the writer has put the points. For example, note
the difference in sense and pause, according as the
comma is placed before or after “to the end,” in the
following sentence:</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>I have advised the Attorney-General to read this letter to
the end, that he may see precisely how this matter will affect
public interest.</p>

<p class="padtopc">I have advised the Attorney-General to read this letter, to
the end that he may see precisely how this matter will affect
public interest.</p></div>

<p>Murray’s large octavo English Grammar and countless
common-school grammars, from Murray’s time to
the present day, contain rules for aiding students
and writers to decide where points, and what points,
should be placed. These are of great utility, and
every young person should familiarize himself with
them as found, briefly stated, in books now in use.
It should be borne in mind, however, that a close
and slavish adherence to stated forms, without ascertaining
their bearings in individual cases, tends to
becloud the judgment, and may cause an author’s
meaning to be obscured, or even concealed, rather
than elucidated.</p>

<p>In books issued by different houses will be found
great diversity in the manner of pointing similar and
even the same sentences; and some part of what we
have called “style” results from the
effort of a <span class="xxpn" id="p077">{p77}</span>
house to be consistent with itself, and to establish
a uniformity among its own issues.</p>

<p>The rules given in this chapter, and the observations
accompanying them, are mainly the results of
our own training and experience as compositor and
proof-reader at different periods, covering in the aggregate
more than twenty years. To bring out by
punctuation the sense of difficult and involved sentences—which
are of frequent occurrence—requires
close attention and careful study,—attention not the
less close, nor study the less careful, because prompted
by the necessity of immediate practical application.</p>

<p>As all rules suitable to guide human conduct lie
folded up in the golden rule, so all rules for pointing
sentences are embraced in this: Punctuate so
as to bring out the author’s meaning. And by their
consonance with this great rule all special rules must
be judged. Yet in this, as in all other matters, men
disagree in their judgments; and we must be content
in our diversities, until the academy desiderated by
the “Spectator” shall have become an actual institution,
invested with a <i>quasi</i> grammatical infallibility.</p>

<p>For instance, as to placing a comma between a
nominative phrase or sentence and the predicate, the
best authorities differ. Wilson’s rule <span class="nowrap">is,—</span></p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>“No point or pause-mark is admissible between the subject
or nominative and the predicate, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p></div>

<p>The “Practical Grammar,” by S. W. Clark, A.M.,
published by A. S. Barnes &amp; Co., New York, gives
the following rule: <span class="xxpn" id="p078">{p78}</span></p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>“A phrase or sentence used as the subject of a verb, requires
a comma between it and the verb.”</p></div>

<p>Of course the examples under the rule exhibit a
corresponding difference.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>“To be totally indifferent to praise or censure is a real
defect in character.”—<i>Wilson.</i></p>

<p>“To do good to others, constitutes an important object of
existence.”—<i>Clark.</i></p></div>

<p>Ingersoll’s Grammar (Portland, 1828) and Kerl’s—which
last is now very extensively used—agree
with Clark. Both have the same example as Wilson,
but pointed as <span class="nowrap">follows:—</span></p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>“To be totally indifferent to praise or censure, is a real
defect in character.”</p></div>

<p>Goold Brown (Grammar of Grammars) inserts the
comma. Cobbett’s Grammar omits it.</p>

<p>Take up the first dozen books that come to hand,
and you will find diversity of practice.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>“The influences which Atterbury had fostered long lingered
in the precincts.”—<i>Stanley’s Westminster Abbey.</i></p>

<p>“The distinction between transcendental and transcendent,
is observed by our elder divines and philosophers.”—<i>Coleridge’s
Biographia.</i></p>

<p>“The interruption of friendly relations between England
and Spain was the fault .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of the Emperor.”—<i>Froude’s
England.</i></p></div>

<p>The better method is to omit the comma, except in
those cases where its insertion would prevent ambiguity;
as in the quotation above, from Stanley, where
there should have been a
comma after “fostered”; <span class="xxpn" id="p079">{p79}</span>
as it stands, the word “long” may qualify either the
word before or after it.</p>

<p>So, if you examine any number of volumes with
reference to placing a comma before <i>and</i>, <i>or</i>, or <i>nor</i>,
when three or more words, in the same category, are
connected,—in some you will find “Faith, and hope,
and charity”; in others, “Faith and hope and charity.”
We have just met with the following lines in
a well-known paper:</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Round
 and round the atoms fly,</div>
<div class="dpp00">Turf, and stone, and sea, and sky.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">Wilson’s example is (p. <span
class="nowrap">38),—</span></p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>“Let us freely drink in the soul of love and beauty
and wisdom from all nature and art and history.”</p></div>

<p>In view of these and similar differences of practice,
and contradiction of rules, one is tempted to say that
it is of no moment whether the commas are inserted
or not. But, leaving “style” out of the question, a
proof-reader should endeavor to have a reason for
every omission he allows, and for every insertion he
makes. We advise him, then, in the first place to
note which method seems required by the golden
rule of elucidating the meaning; then consider, further,
if the sentence already contains commas, whether
inserting more would offend the eye. Let him decide
each case on its own merits; leaning, when in doubt,
in favor of such grammatical rule as he may have
adopted. But use judgment; for the most precise
grammarians lay down pages of exceptions; and Cobbett
(Grammar, Letter
<span class="nowrap"><span class="smmaj">XIV.</span>)</span> cannot
be gainsaid when <span class="xxpn" id="p080">{p80}</span>
he writes, “It is evident, that, in many cases, the use
of the comma must depend upon taste.”</p>

<p>When a phrase or clause, in its nature parenthetic,
is quite closely connected with the parts of the
sentence in which it is placed, the insertion of the
comma before and after such phrase or clause “must
depend upon taste.” The former comma especially,
may often be omitted (see Obs. 10, under Rule 16,
<i>post</i>). If the commas are inserted, we have a specimen
of what is called “close pointing”; if omitted,
we have “liberal pointing.”</p>

<p>Close pointing prevails in almost all publications
except law-work, and in all doubtful cases puts in the
comma. Liberal pointing, on the other hand, omits
the points except when absolutely necessary to avoid
ambiguity.</p>

<p>A middle course, retaining the spirit rather than
adhering to the letter of the rules, will be found the
safest. When, as will often be the case, a passage
occurs, the meaning of which varies with the insertion
or omission of a comma, while it would be grammatical
either way, the compositor should <i>follow the
copy</i>; the proof-reader should mark the passages
with his quære; but if he first notices the fault when
reading the press-proof, he should suffer it to stand
as the author left it, letting all responsibility remain
where it rightfully belongs.</p>

<p>Abbreviated words, besides the period denoting
their ab­bre­vi­a­tion, require the same pointing as if
they were spelled in full. Thus “Jno. Smith, Esq.,
of Worcester; Abel Soane, M.D.;
and James Doe, <span class="xxpn" id="p081">{p81}</span>
LL.D.,—were appointed a comm. to take care of
books, docs., etc., etc.,” has the same pointing as
“John Smith, Esquire, of Worcester; Abel Soane,
Doctor of Medicine; and James Doe, Doctor of
Laws,—were appointed a committee to take care of
books, documents, and so forth, and so forth.” But
in some classes of work, as Directories, Catalogues
of books, Genealogies, and where titles and ab­bre­vi­a­tions
are of frequent occurrence, double pointing
may be partially avoided by omitting the comma
after a period which denotes an ab­bre­vi­a­tion.</p>

<p class="padtopc">Neatness requires the omission of the comma before
leaders; thus,</p>

<div class="blockquot ffmono">
<p>John Roe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;New Oleans.</p>
<p>James Doe.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;San Francisco.</p>
</div>

<p class="pcontinue">is more pleasing to the eye than</p>

<div class="blockquot ffmono">
<p>John Roe,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;New Orleans.</p>
<p>James Doe,&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;San Francisco.</p>
</div>

<p>Preambles to resolutions and laws are usually
begun with “Whereas.” After this word a comma
is sometimes heedlessly inserted, although the introductory
word is not followed by a parenthetic clause.
We append the most improved forms for punctuating
and cap­i­tal­iz­ing preambles, resolves, and provisos:</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>Whereas the present national interest in the matter of the
American fisheries has, &amp;c.—<i>Cong. Record, July, 11, 1888.</i></p>

<p>Whereas, owing to the sudden demise of the secretary, no
notice was given of the receipts of the plans, etc.:</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That the whole matter be referred to a committee:
<i>Provided</i>, [or <i>Provided however</i>,] That the whole expense shall
not exceed, etc. <span class="xxpn" id="p082">{p82}</span></p></div>

<p>The semicolon should be placed before <i>as</i>, in an
enumeration of particulars following a general statement;
thus:</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>Many proper names admit of convenient contractions; as
Jno., Wm., Benj., Jas., Chas.</p></div>

<p>But when <i>as</i> is not preceded by a general or formal
statement, no point is necessary unless <i>as</i> is followed
by a parenthetic clause; as:</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>Such names as John, Benjamin, William, admit of convenient
contractions.</p>

<p>Some fishes, as, for instance, the cod, delight in cold baths,
and are never found in water above 40° Fahr., unless in care
of the cook.</p></div>

<p>But in liberal pointing, the commas before and
after “for instance” would be omitted.</p>

<p>In regard to the points or marks connected with
<span class="spwdspb">“viz.,” “namely,”</span> and “to wit,” the punctuation
varies according to the structure of the sentences in
which they occur; but this does not prevent a publishing-house
from having a style of its own. It is
interesting to note the varieties which different offices
present. We annex a few examples, which may be
serviceable; to wit:</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>“Sussex Co., Del., July 5, 1776. We are sorry to say, that
it is our opinion that they (viz: the enemies of the war) are
not better affected than they were before the troops came.”—<i>Am.

namely: (1) that all to whom land is patented become at once
citizens of the United States; (2) that all, etc.—<i>ib.</i></p>

<p>There are four seasons, namely: spring, summer, autumn,

<p>Annapolis, June 25, 1776. That four battalions be instantly
raised .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. each company to consist of ninety men, to wit:
one captain, two lieutenants, etc.—<i>Am. Archives.</i></p></div>

<p>When <i>viz.</i> or <i>namely</i> or <i>as follows</i> ends a paragraph,
the colon is commonly inserted; but the
dash or comma-dash or colon-dash may sometimes
be noticed,—it is a matter of office style. (See
Punctuation, Rule 8, <i>post</i>.)</p>

<p>But if, referring to a succeeding sentence or paragraph,
the words “the following” or “as follows”
appear, the sentence in which they occur should be
closed with the colon or colon-dash, as in the following
examples: <span class="xxpn" id="p084">{p84}</span></p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>The description given of the English Nonconformists in
many pages that stand for history, is as follows: That they
started forth under a well-settled order of constitution and
discipline of the Church of England, etc.—<i>Ellis’s Puritan
Age.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Faulkner, from the Committee on Pensions, to whom
were referred the following bills, reported them severally
without amendment, and submitted reports thereon:</p>

<p>A bill (H. R. 10318) granting a pension to Mary C. Davis;
and</p>

<p>A bill (H. R. 8400) to place the name of John J. Mitchell
on the pension-roll.—<i>Congressional Record, July 22, ’88.</i></p></div>

<p>The hyphen is used to connect the parts of a compound
word; to show the divisions of words into
syllables; it is placed at the end of a line when a
word is not finished; and it is sometimes placed
between vowels, to show that they belong to different
syllables (as “co-ordinate”). In regard to its use
in compound words great diversity exists; and the
proof-reader can have, as we believe, no fixed system
which will apply to all varieties of work. In specifications
for bridges, buildings, etc., the better way is
to avoid compounding; for, in everything of that
kind, one will find so many <span class="spwdspb">“door-sills,” “newel-posts,”
“stair-balusters,” “pulley-stiles,”</span> etc., that if
he begin marking in the hyphens he will scarcely
make an end of it, and many hyphens sadly deform a
page: better put “door <span class="spwdspb">knobs,” “window</span> <span class="spwdspb">frames,”
“stair</span> nosings,” etc., omitting hyphens.</p>

<p>Here, too, the dictionaries can scarcely be said
to assist, if they do not even mislead. Worcester
has <span class="spwdspb">“brickwork,”
“brasswork,”</span> without hyphens; <span class="xxpn" id="p085">{p85}</span>
<span class="spwdspb">“wood-work,” “iron-work,”</span> with them. “Greenhouse”
is closed up, while “school-house” is not;
“wood-house” has a hyphen, “almshouse” has none.
(Wilson writes “schoolhouse.”) Webster has “brick-work”
with the hyphen, “woodwork” without it,—just
reversing Worcester. Again, Worcester writes,
“humblebee” and “bumblebee”: Webster, under B,
has “bumble-bee, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sometimes called humble-bee”;
and, under H, writes “humblebee, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
often called bumblebee,” apparently forgetful of his
previous hyphens.</p>

<p>To search for authority, then, in the matter of compounding
words, will avail next to nothing. In a
volume containing “School Committees’ Reports,”—and
certainly school committees ought to know many
things,—we find “blackboard” and “black-board”;
and, on one page, <span class="spwdspb">“schoolbooks,” “schoolkeeping,”
“schoolmaster,” “school-houses,” “school-checks.”
“Semi-annual”</span> is frequently printed with the hyphen,
according to Webster; but Worcester, omitting
the hyphen, has “semiannual.”</p>

<p>Thus it appears, that, in regard to compounding
(by which we mean inserting the hyphen between
the parts of a compound word), the proof-reader is
left to his own discretion, and can do very much as
he pleases. He should, however, adopt some method
by which he can approximate to uniformity in his
own work; for as to agreeing with anybody else,
that is out of the question.</p>

<p>Perhaps as good a rule as can be laid down on this
subject is to close up
the word when <span class="xxpn" id="p086">{p86}</span>
compounding changes the accentuation; otherwise, insert the
hyphen. Thus, “Quartermaster” has a different
accentuation from the two words “quarter master”;
therefore make one word of it, without the hyphen.
“Head-assistant” is accented like the two words
“head assistant,”—therefore insert the hyphen. By
this rule “schoolhouse” and “blackboard” should be
severally closed up; “salt-mine” takes the hyphen,—“saltsea”
(adjective) does not.</p>

<p>The word “tree,” with a prefix indicating
the kind, should be compounded; as <span
class="spwdspb">“oak-tree,” “forest-tree,”
“pine-tree,”</span> etc. (Webster has a hyphen in
“whiffle-tree,” Worcester prints “whiffletree.”)</p>

<p>“Cast-iron” and “wrought-iron” are usually compounded,
and should always be so when used as
adjectives; as “cast-iron <span class="spwdspb">pillars,” “wrought-iron</span>
boilers.”</p>

<p>“Temple-street place” (or “Place,” according to
style), “Suffolk-street <span class="spwdspb">District,” “Pemberton-square</span>
School,” are quite correct; the hyphen is too frequently
omitted in such cases.</p>

<p>The words <i>ex officio</i> do not require a hyphen, but
some very reputable offices insert it.</p>

<p>Hyphens are sometimes used to indicate grotesque
pronunciation, as in the following couplet from “Rejected
Addresses”:</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>In
 borrowed luster seemed to sham</div>
<div class="dpp00">The rose and red sweet Will-i-am.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>When two words connected by a conjunction are
severally compound parts of a following word,
the hyphen is omitted; as: <span class="xxpn"
id="p087">{p87}</span></p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpp00">We use cast and wrought iron pillars.</div>
<div class="dpp00">I have pruned my peach and apple trees.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Some authors follow the German style, inserting
the hyphens; thus:</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpp00">We use cast- and wrought-iron pillars.</div>
<div class="dpp00">I have pruned my peach- and apple-trees.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">But this style is rare.</p>

<p>Precision requires that hyphens should be inserted
in fractions expressed in words; as <span class="spwdspb">“one-half,”
“three-fifths,”</span> etc.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>How many oranges are seven and three fourths oranges?</p></div>

<p>There being no hyphen in the above example, the
“seven” and “three” are in the same category as
“peach” and “apple” in the last previous example.
The answer is ten‐fourths, or 2&#x2060;½.</p>

<p>If “seven” is meant to express a whole number, a
hyphen should be inserted after “three.”</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>A prolific source of trouble in correcting is wrong
syllabication when it is thought necessary to carry
part of a word to the succeeding line. Neither the
English method of dividing on vowels, where this
can be conveniently done, nor the American method
of dividing on syllables, obtains exclusively in this
country. Convenience, and the desire of spacing in
such a manner as to make the lines look well, frequently
determine the dividing letter; so that, in the
same work, you may find “pro‐perty” and <span class="spwdspb">“prop‐erty,”
“trea‐sure”</span> and “treas‐ure.” In a recent
English work, we note
the following divisions: <span class="xxpn" id="p088">{p88}</span>
Pre‐bendaries, mea‐sure, pre‐decessors, supre‐macy, the
Re‐formation, pro‐perty, theo‐logy, bre‐thren, pre‐paration.</p>

<p>But the division on the syllable is the mode most
generally practiced in the United States, and we
must, however reluctantly, adhere to it as closely as
possible, until a convention of publishers shall sanction
the adoption of the English usage. Our authorities
close the first syllable of “fa‐ther” on the <i>a</i>, of
“moth‐er” on the <i>th</i>, so that, practically, the latter
word should not be divided at all; the English
printer, without hesitation, places the hyphen after
the <i>a</i> and the <i>o</i> respectively.</p>

<p>As to the word “discrepancy” there is a discrepancy.
Webster accents the second syllable, and
divides “discrep‐ancy”; while Worcester accents the
first syllable, and divides “discre‐pancy.” In this,
printers and readers must be governed by the “style”
of the work upon which they are engaged.</p>

<p>One of the most frequently recurring errors noticed
in reading first proof is the placing of an <i>s</i> at
the end of a line when it should have been carried
over. Corres‐pondence, des‐cribe, des‐cription, Aus‐tralian,
are wrong, and are corrected daily; and their
reappearance proves that in this, as in weightier matters,
“error is wrought by want of thought.”</p>

<p>In newspapers, or any work which is to be read
once and then cast aside, the carrying over of an <i>ed</i>
or <i>ly</i>, or any other syllable of two letters, may perhaps
be tolerated; but in bookwork such a division
is inexcusable, except in side‐notes,
or when the <span class="xxpn" id="p089">{p89}</span>
measure is very narrow. To avoid extremely wide
or thin spacing, and to escape the trouble and expense
of overrunning pages already imposed, it must
be considered admissible, in certain cases, to carry
over a consonant preceding the final syllable <i>ed</i>; as,
expec‐ted, divi‐ded. We state this with some misgivings;
but, as we have known it to be done by
excellent readers and skillful printers, even by John
Wilson himself, of blessed memory, we lay it down
as allowable in extreme cases. Theories are elastic,—are
expansible and compressible; but types of
metal have set dimensions of extension, and, in some
circumstances, absolutely refuse to budge,—wherefore
theories must gracefully yield, and allow, it may
be, a two‐letter division even in wide measure.
Types are tyrannical, and will sometimes perpetrate
solecisms under the plea of necessity.</p>

<p>An author can sometimes much improve the appearance
of a page, by slight changes in the phraseology.</p>

<p>A good compositor studies to avoid divisions.
Some printers, rather than divide a word, will justify
a line by separating the words with two three‐em
spaces. But no arbitrary rule can be laid down in
this regard. A well‐spaced page with several divided
words looks much better than a page unevenly spaced
in which no divisions occur. The number of hyphens
occurring in succession at the end of the lines on any
page, should never exceed three.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>In manuscript the dash occurs more frequently
than any other mark of
punctuation, many writers <span class="xxpn" id="p090">{p90}</span>
using it as a substitute for every other point. This
habit very much retards the compositor in his task;
for, as we have already intimated, he feels obliged to
study the sense of his copy, and to waste his valuable
time in considering how he shall best supply
those aids to meaning which the author has rejected,
and without which any work would be wholly unpresentable.</p>

<p>That the author of the paragraph quoted below
pointed it with perfect accuracy before sending it
to press, does not admit of a doubt. For the nonce,
however, we will, with his leave, punctuate the passage
in the manner in which the compositor frequently
finds passages pointed on his “takes”; thus:</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>“It has been said—and—no doubt—truthfully—that the
smartest boys do not go to college. Yet—it is evident—to
every one competent to judge—that the ablest men have been
at college.”</p></div>

<p>With so many dashes before him, it would not be
strange if the compositor were to retain some of them;
and the proof might, perhaps, appear as follows:</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>“It has been said—and no doubt truthfully—that the
smartest boys do not go to college. Yet it is evident to every
one competent to judge, that the ablest men have been at college.”</p></div>

<p>This is much improved; and, if we substitute
commas for the dashes in the first sentence, the
punctuation may be considered unobjectionable.</p>

<p>Beginners at the “case” are often puzzled in regard
to the insertion of commas before
the dashes which <span class="xxpn" id="p091">{p91}</span>
inclose a parenthetic clause. To decide this point,
it is enough to notice whether or not a comma would
be used, were the parenthetic clause omitted. This,
we think, will be readily understood by reference to
the following examples:</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>“It was necessary not only that Christianity should assume
a standard absolutely perfect, but that it should apply a perfect
law to those complex and infinitely diversified cases which
arise when law is violated.”</p></div>

<p>Now, if a parenthetic clause is inserted before the
word “but,” the comma should be retained, and
another placed at the end of the inserted clause;
thus:</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>“It was necessary, not only that Christianity should assume
a standard absolutely perfect,—which, however far from anything
that man has ever done, would be comparatively easy,—but
that it should apply a perfect law,” etc.</p></div>

<p>If there is no comma where the clause is to be
inserted, dashes alone should be used:</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>“In the completed volume of the third report, the countries
wherein education has received the most attention are treated
of at length.”</p></div>

<p>If a parenthetic clause be inserted after “countries,”—where
there is no comma,—only dashes
are required; thus:</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>“In the completed volume of the third report, the countries—Prussia,
for instance—wherein education has received the
most attention are treated of at length.”</p></div>

<p>A thin space should be placed before, and also
after, a dash.</p>

<p>If a parenthesis is inserted in a part
of a sentence <span class="xxpn" id="p092">{p92}</span>
where no point is required, no point should be placed
before or after the marks of parenthesis.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>“By living sparingly, and according to the dictates of reason,
in less than a year I found myself (some persons, perhaps,
will not believe it) entirely freed from all my complaints.”—<i>Cornaro.</i></p></div>

<p>As a general rule, if the parenthesis occur after a
punctuated clause, the point should be placed after
the latter mark of parenthesis.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>“Popham’s monument, by the intercession of his wife’s
friends (who had interest at Court), was left in St. John’s
Chapel on condition either of erasing the inscription, or turning
it inwards.”</p>

<p>“Artist: Kneller (1723). Architects: Taylor (1788);
Chambers (1796); Wyatt (1813).”</p>

<p>“Antiquities of St. Peter’s, by J. Crull (usually signed
J. C.).”</p></div>

<p>If a parenthesis which closes with a note of exclamation
or in­ter­ro­ga­tion is inserted where a point
occurs, that point should precede the first mark of
parenthesis.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>“Where foresight and good morals exist, (and do they not
here?) the taxes do not stand in the way of an industrious
man’s comforts.”</p>

<p>“He directed the letter to Gnat Smith, (spelling Nat with
a G!) and deposited it in a fire‐alarm box.”</p></div>

<p>An exclamation point is often found preceding the
first mark of parenthesis.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>“Ay, here now! (exclaimed the Critic,) here come Coleridge’s
metaphysics!”—<i>Biographia Literaria.</i></p>

<p>“I am, sir, sensible”—“Hear! Hear!”
(they cheer him.) <span class="xxpn"
id="p093">{p93}</span></p></div>

<p>When a parenthesis occurs within a parenthesis,
brackets should be substituted for the first and last
parenthetic marks.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>“As for the other party [I mean (do not misunderstand
me) the original inventor], he was absent from the country,
at that time.”</p></div>

<p>“Brackets are generally used .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to inclose an
explanation, note, or observation, standing by itself.”—<i>Parker’s
Aids.</i></p>

<p>A short comment inserted in a paragraph by a
reviewer is placed in brackets.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>“The sacks were badly eaten by rags [so in the affidavit],
and the almonds had run out.”</p></div>

<p>In transcripts of trials at law, brackets are used to
inclose statements of things done in court, which
things would not appear in a report of the verbal
proceedings alone; <span class="nowrap">as,—</span></p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>“<i>Ans.</i> About a quarter past ten, he came into my shop,
and picked out a cane. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>“<i>Gore.</i> Of what wood was it made?</p>

<p>“<i>Ans.</i> It was a good piece of hickory—heavy for hickory. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>“[The stick was handed to the witness, who declared it to
be the same he had sold Mr. Charles Austin.]</p>

<p>“<i>Gore.</i> What sticks had he usually bought of you?”—<i>Trial
of Selfridge.</i></p></div>

<p>Whether the words in brackets should also be
in italics is a matter of style. In the following
passage from the same report, italics are used: <span
class="xxpn" id="p094">{p94}</span></p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>“<i>Gore.</i> [<i>Showing the fracture of the hat on the fore‐part.</i>]
Is not that the fore‐part of the hat, as this leather [<i>that on the
hinder part</i>] marks the part of the hat that is worn behind?”</p></div>

<p>For inserting commas or other points after, before,
or within brackets, the same rules apply as in case of
marks of parenthesis.</p>

<p class="padtopc">Whether when a noun singular
terminates in <i>s</i>, its possessive case requires an
additional <i>s</i> is yet an open question. We have no
hesitation in giving an affirmative answer, especially
in the case of proper names. If Mr. Adams were to
manufacture ale, one might, perhaps, from prohibitory
considerations, advise him to advertise it as “Adams’
ale”; but should Mr. Adams have no fear of the law,
he would avoid all misunderstanding by calling it
“Adams’s ale.” It may be objected that the position
of the apostrophe makes the matter sufficiently clear
without the additional <i>s</i>. Yes,—to the eye; but to
the ear the propriety of the additional <i>s</i> becomes
very apparent. “Jacob’s pillow” and “Jacobs’s pillow”
may be of very different materials. But, to avoid too
much sibilation, we read “for conscience’ <span class="spwdspb">sake,” “for</span>
goodness’ sake,” etc.</p>

<p class="padtopc">The apostrophe, with <i>s</i> subjoined,
is used to denote the plural of letters and
figures.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>“The discipline which is imposed by proving that some <i>x</i>’s are
some <i>y</i>’s, and that other <i>x</i>’s are all <i>y</i>’s, will enable you to
pulverize any hot‐headed deacon who may hereafter attempt to prove
that you had better be looking out for another pastorate.”—<i>Ad
Clerum.</i></p>

<p>“This 7 differs from the other 7’s.” <span
class="xxpn" id="p095">{p95}</span></p></div>

<p>The apostrophe may be used in denoting the plural
whenever its use will assist in avoiding obscurity.</p>

useful by teachers and scholars, and our friends of
the press.</p></div><!--section-->

<div class="section" id="p096">
<h3 class="h3a">RULES OF PUNCTUATION.</h3>

<h4>I. PERIOD, OR FULL POINT.</h4>

<p>1. The period is used at the end of every complete
sentence which is not interrogative or exclamatory.</p>

<p>2. Sentences interrogative and exclamatory in
form, sometimes take the period.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>Will you call at my office, say on Tuesday next, or whenever
you happen to be in town, and much oblige—</p>

<span class="smcap">S<b>MITH</b>.</span></div>

<p class="padtopc">How much better it is, considering
the saving of distance to the pupils, that two small
schoolhouses should be built, rather than one large
one.</p></div><!--section-->

<p>3. The period is put after initials when used
alone; also after ab­bre­vi­a­tions.</p>

<div class="dblockquota"><ul>
<li>J. Q. Adams.</li>
<li>Supt. of R. R.</li>
<li>A. M.</li>
</ul></div>

<p>4. Place a period before decimals, and between
pounds and shillings.</p>

<div class="dblockquota"><ul>
<li>The French meter is 3.2808992 feet.</li>
<li>£24. 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i></li>
<li>5.75 miles.</li></ul>
</div><!--dblockquota-->

<p>5. A period should always be put after roman
numerals, except when used in the paging of prefaces,
etc.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>George III. came to the throne in 1760.</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p><span class="smcap">O<b>BSERVATION</b></span> 1.
In many modern works the period is omitted; <span
class="nowrap">as,—</span></p>

<p>William I made a mistake.</p>

<p class="pcontinue">There being no comma after
“William,” it is supposed to be obvious that the
mistake was made by William the First. The insertion
or omission of the period is becoming wholly a
matter of printing-office style.</p></div>
</div><!--section-->

<div class="section" id="p097">
<h4>II. COLON.</h4>

<p>6. A colon is put at the end of a clause complete
in sense, when something follows which tends to
make the sense fuller or clearer. (<i>See</i> Rules 9
and 13.)</p>

<div class="dblockquot"> <p>There is yet another
sphere for the electric motor to fill: that of street
railway propulsion.—<i>N. A. Review; April, 1888.</i></p>

<p>In free states no man should take up arms, but with
a view to defend his country and its laws: he puts off
the citizen when he enters the camp; but it is because
he is a citizen, and would continue to be so, that he
makes himself for a while a soldier.—<i>Blackstone’s
Commentaries, Book I., Ch. 13.</i></p></div>

<p>7. The last of several clauses that introduce a
concluding remark or sentiment should be followed
by a colon, if the preceding clauses have been punctuated
with semicolons.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>A pickpocket in every car; a cheat at every station; every
third switch on the road misplaced; the danger of being hurled
from the track, and then burned alive: these considerations
prevent my traveling on the railroad of which you speak.</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p><span class="smcap">O<b>BS.</b></span> 2. In
examples like the above, a very common and perhaps
better method is to put a comma and dash in place
of the colon. The colon is neater, but more
old-fashioned. (See second example under Rule 10.)</p></div>

<p>8. The colon is commonly used whenever an example,
a quotation, or a speech is introduced.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>The Scriptures give us an amiable representation of the
Deity in these words: “God is love.”</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p><span class="smcap">O<b>BS.</b></span> 3. Modern writers, instead of the colon, mostly use the
semicolon, dash, or period. Our first example, under Rule 9,—with
a colon substituted for the semicolon,—might with propriety
have been placed under Rule 6. We prefer the
semicolon, however; <span class="xxpn" id="p098">{p98}</span>
and if the word <i>for</i> were inserted in the example mentioned, the
colon would be inadmissible:</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>“Let there be no strife between theology and science; for there
need be none.”</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>In reprinting old works, the colon should be carefully retained,
as essential to a clear understanding of them.</p>

<p>The colon is generally placed after <i>as follows</i>, <i>the following</i>, <i>in
these words</i>, <i>thus</i>, or any other word or phrase which formally
introduces something; and when the matter introduced forms a
distinct paragraph, the colon may or may not be followed by a
dash, as the style of the author or office may require.</p></div>

<h4>III. SEMICOLON.</h4>

<p>9. When two or more clauses of a sentence are
not so closely connected as to admit the use of a
comma, a semicolon is used.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>Let there be no strife between theology and science; there
need be none.</p>

<p>Wisdom hath builded her house; she hath hewn out her
seven pillars; she hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled
her wine; she hath also furnished her table.</p></div>

<p>10. When a number of particulars depend on an
introductory or a final clause, such particulars may
be separated from each other by a semicolon.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>There are three difficulties in authorship: to write anything
worth the publishing; to get honest men to publish it; and to
get sensible men to read it.</p>

<p>To present a general view of the whole Vedic literature; to
define its extent; to divide it into well-distinguished classes of
writings; to portray the circumstances of their origin, and the
stage of cultural development which they represent; and to
explain the method of their preservation and transmission to
us,—were some of the objects which
Müller had in view. <span class="xxpn" id="p099">{p99}</span></p></div>

<p>11. Loosely connected clauses of a sentence should
be separated by semicolons, if those clauses or any of
them are subdivided by commas.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>As the rays of the sun, notwithstanding their velocity, injure
not the eye by reason of their minuteness; so the attacks of
envy, notwithstanding their number, ought not to wound our
virtue by reason of their insignificance.</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p><span class="smcap">O<b>BS.</b></span> 4. In the
first sentence of the following example, a comma
between the clauses is sufficient, because there are
no points in the clauses; but the second sentence may
serve to illustrate Rules 11 and 12:</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>As there are some faults that have been termed faults on the
right side, so there are some errors that might be denominated
errors on the safe side. Thus, we seldom regret having been too
mild, too cautious, or too humble; but we often repent having been
too violent, too precipitate, or too proud.</p></div>

<p>12. When two clauses not closely dependent on
each other, are connected by <i>but</i>, <i>for</i>, <i>and</i>, or some
similar connective, they are separated by a semicolon.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>I will not be revenged, and this I owe to my enemy; but I
will remember, and this I owe to myself.</p>

<p>A wise minister would rather preserve peace than gain a
victory; because he knows that even the most successful war
leaves nations generally more poor, always more profligate,
than it found them.</p>

<p>Ingratitude in a superior is very often nothing more than
the refusal of some unreasonable request; and if the patron
does too little, it is not unfrequently because the dependent
expects too much.</p></div>

<p>13. Phrases are often set off by a semicolon, viz.:</p>

<p><i>a.</i> Explanatory phrases.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>There remain to us moderns, only two roads to success;
discovery and conquest.</p></div>

<p><i>b.</i> Participial and adjective phrases. <span
class="xxpn" id="p100">{p100}</span></p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>I have first considered whether it be worth while to say anything
at all, before I have taken any trouble to say it well;
knowing that words are but air, and that both are capable of
much condensation.</p>

<p>These roads are what all roads should be; suitable for light
carriages, and for heavy-laden wagons.</p></div>

<p><i>c.</i> Any phrase, especially if elliptical, or if divisible
into smaller portions by commas.</p>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>(<span class="smcap">O<b>BS.</b></span> 5. In
speaking or in writing, we “almost always leave out
some of the words which are necessary to a full
expression of our meaning. This leaving out is called
the ellipsis.”)</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>John Milton; born Dec. 9, 1608; completed Paradise Lost,
1665; died Nov. 10, 1674.</p></div>

<h4>IV. COMMA.</h4>

<p>14. Repeated words or expressions; three or more
serial terms; two unconnected serial terms,—are
separated from each other by the comma.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> Repeated words or expressions.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>Shut, shut the door.</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpp06">I, I, I, I itself, I,</div>
<div class="dpp00">The inside and outside, the what and the why,</div>
<div class="dpp00">The when and the where, and the low and the high,</div>
<div class="dpp06">All I, I, I, I itself, I.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Give me back, give me back the wild freshness of morning.</p>
</div>

<p><i>b.</i> Three or more serial terms.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>Shakspeare, Butler, and Bacon have rendered it extremely
difficult for all who come after them to be sublime, witty, or
profound.</p>

<p>The firm of Smith, Longman, Jones, Llewellyn, &amp; Co.</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>But some printers, while observing the above rule
in general, except the names of firms and railroad
companies; which, in their publications, appear as
follows: <span class="xxpn" id="p101">{p101}</span></p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>The firm of Longman, Jones, Llewellyn &amp; Co.</p>

<p>The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fé R. R. Co.</p></div>

<p><i>c.</i> Two unconnected serial terms.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>He had a keen, ready wit.</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p><span class="smcap">O<b>BS.</b></span> 6. The
second example under <i>a</i> (“The inside and outside, the
what and the why,”) furnishes an il­lus­tra­tion of the
mode of punctuating terms joined in pairs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O<b>BS.</b></span> 7. Style
sometimes requires the omission of the comma before
<i>and</i>, <i>or</i>, <i>nor</i>, when one of these connectives
precedes the last term of a series: as “Shakspeare,
Butler and Bacon have rendered it extremely difficult
for all who come after them to be sublime, witty or
profound.” But when the words are all in the same
predicament, the comma should be inserted; e. g.,—if
you wish to state that three certain persons are wise,
you would point thus:</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
“Thomas, Richard, and John are wise.”
</div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p class="pcontinue">But if Richard and John are the
Solons, and you wish to inform Thomas of that fact,
you would point thus:</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
“Thomas, Richard and John are wise.”
</div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>So, in the first example under <i>b</i>, if it is desired to qualify the
three adjectives by the phrase “in the highest degree,” the comma
after <i>witty</i> must stand: “in the highest degree sublime, witty, or
profound.” But if that phrase is intended to apply to <i>sublime</i>
only, the pointing should be thus: “in the highest degree sublime,
witty or profound.”</p></div>

<p>15. Phrases, clauses, and words, inverted, or otherwise
not in their natural position, generally require
to be set off by a comma.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>Into this illustrious society, my friend was joyfully received.</p>

<p>When we quarrel with ourselves, we are sure to be losers.</p>

<p>To satisfy you on that point, I will make a short argument.</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpp00">He, like the world, his ready visits pays,</div>
<div class="dpp00">Where fortune smiles.</div>

<p>Roe, <span class="spwdspa">Richard.      Doe,</span> John.</p>
</div><!--dblockquot-->

<div class="dobsn" id="p102">
<p><span class="smcap">O<b>BS.</b></span> 8. The
exceptions to this rule are numerous. If the first and
last words of a passage are related (<i>for him</i> the
summer wind <i>murmured</i>); if the inverted phrase be
brief, and can be read in close connection with what
follows (<i>in youth</i> we have little sympathy with the
misfortunes of age); or if the principal clause is
itself inverted (In the center of the common rises a
noble monument),—the comma is usually omitted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O<b>BS.</b></span> 9. In long
lists of proper names, as Directories, etc., it is
usual to omit the comma, although the names are
transposed, and to print thus:</p></div>

<div class="dblockquota"><ul>
<li>Smith James W.</li>
<li>Thomson Theophilus.</li>
</ul></div>

<p>16. When the principal sentence is broken to
receive an incidental or parenthetic expression, a
comma is placed at the break, and another at the
end of the inserted clause.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>Rulers and magistrates should attempt to operate on the
minds of their respective subjects, if possible, by reward

</div></div></div><!--dblockquot-->

<div class="dobsn">
<p><span class="smcap">O<b>BS.</b></span> 10. The
former comma is frequently omitted. Especially is
this the case when the previous part of the sentence
has required commas. Liberal pointing would omit the
comma after “where,” in the above example. And in the
following sentence, from General Marcy’s “Ramblings in
the West,” note the omission of the comma after “and,”
and from the parenthetic clause “it was believed”:</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>This, with the destruction of our trains, consumed the greater
part of our winter supplies, and as they could not be replenished

believed supplies could be obtained earlier than
from farther east. <span class="xxpn" id="p103">{p103}</span></p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>Notice, also, the omission of the comma after “and” and
“but,” in the following paragraphs:</p></div>

time</i>, <i>on the other hand</i>, etc.)</p></div>

<p>17. Words or phrases expressing contrast, or emphatically
distinguished, and terms having a common
relation to some other term that follows them, require
the comma.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> Contrast or notable difference.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O<b>BS.</b></span> 11. Two
contrasted words having a common dependence, and
connected by <i>but</i>, <i>though</i>, <i>yet</i>, or <i>as well as</i>,
should not be separated; as, There are springs of
clear but brackish water.</p></div>

<p><i>b.</i> Terms having a common relation to a succeeding

<div class="dblockquot">

<div class="dobsn">
<p><span class="smcap">O<b>BS.</b></span> 12. Some
proof-readers, however, omit the second comma, when
but a single word follows the latter proposition; as,
“Many states were in alliance <i>with</i>, and under the
protection <i>of</i> Rome.” The better method is to insert
the point. “[Bonner was] an accomplished Italian, and
probably also a Spanish, scholar.”—<i>Froude.</i></p></div>

Sometimes when <i>that</i>, and generally when <i>as</i>

<p>It has, by some grammarians, been given as a rule, to use
a comma to set off every part of a compound sentence, which
part has in it a verb not in the infinitive mode.</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p><span class="smcap">O<b>BS.</b></span> 14. A
dependent clause should be separated by a comma,

beginning with <i>as</i>, <i>because</i>, <i>if</i>, <i>wherever</i>,
<i>how</i>, <i>lest</i>, <i>than</i>, <i>that</i>, <i>when</i>, <i>where</i>,
<i>whether</i>, <i>while</i>, <i>why</i>, or any <span class="xxpn"
id="p106">{p106}</span> adverb of time, place, or
manner, follows a clause with which it is closely
connected in sense, it is not set off by a comma: “He
went away when the boat <span class="spwdspb">left.”
“We</span> love him because he first loved <span
class="spwdspb">us.” “He</span> will pay if he is <span
class="spwdspb">able.” “Tell</span> me whether you will
return.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O<b>BS.</b></span> 16.
An infinitive phrase closely connected with
what it modifies, should not be set off by a
comma; as, “We use language to express our <span
class="spwdspb">thoughts.” “Nouns</span> do not vary
their endings to denote certain cases.” But if the
infinitive phrase is preceded by <i>in order</i>, or if
it is remote from what it modifies, it should be set
off by a comma. “He collected a great many young elms
from various parts of England, to adorn his <span
class="spwdspb">grounds.” “If</span> dissimulation
is ever to be pardoned, it is that which men have
recourse to, in order to obtain situations which will
enlarge their sphere of general usefulness.”</p></div>

<p>21. A word or phrase used in apposition, to explicate
or illustrate a previous word or phrase, should
be set off by commas; but if the words in apposition
constitute a single phrase or a proper name, they
should not be separated.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> Comma required.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>Johnson, that mighty Caliban of literature, is held up to
view in the pages of Boswell.</p>

<p>The alligator, or cayman, is found in the Orinoco.</p>

and knowledge.</p></div>

<p>If the position of the terms in apposition is reversed,
commas are required.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>The apostle of the Gentiles, Paul, was eminent for his zeal
and knowledge.</p>

<p>That old last century poet, Crowley, sings thus.</p></div>

<p>22. A simple sentence usually requires no point
except the period at the end of it.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>Count Bismarck has preserved a pleasant intimacy with his
old preceptor.</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p><span class="smcap">O<b>BS.</b></span> 17. When the
subject is a clause ending with a verb, or with a noun
that might be mistaken for the nominative, a comma
should be inserted before the predicate.</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">

<p>Captain Smith’s obedience to orders, issued in his promotion.</p>

<p>In the following sentence, a comma after “them” might not

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>During this campaign hundreds if not thousands of miles

<div class="dobsn">
<p><span class="smcap">O<b>BS.</b></span> 18. Whether
a comma should be inserted after the verb <i>to be</i>,
when that verb is followed by an infinitive clause
which might by transposition be made the nominative,
is a question on which the best authorities
differ.</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p><i>First Method.</i>—The highest art of the mind of man

<p><i>Second Method.</i>—The highest art of the mind of man
is, to possess itself with tranquillity in the hour of

<div class="dobsn">
<p>We are of opinion that usage is in favor of the omission of the
comma, as in the following examples:</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>The proposed object of the Union Dictionary is to comprehend
at once all that is truly useful in Johnson, Sheridan, and Walker.—<i>Thomas
Browne.</i></p>

<p>The grandest of all conditions is to be at once healthy and wise
and good.—<i>D’Arcy Thompson.</i></p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p><span class="smcap">O<b>BS.</b></span> 19. When the
subject is an infinitive phrase, the better method is
not to separate it; as, “To be totally indifferent
to praise or censure is a real defect in character.”
Still there is excellent authority for inserting a
comma, thus: “To be totally indifferent to praise or
censure, is a real defect in character.” In sentences
of this kind we advise the proof-reader to omit the
comma unless the author is uniform in the insertion of
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O<b>BS.</b></span> 20. Some
grammarians set off by a comma the predicate, when
it refers to separated nominatives preceding it; as,
“The benches, chairs, and tables, were thrown down.”
And, again, we find this example given: “Veracity,
justice, and charity, are essential virtues.” So, in
the ordinances of the City of Boston, “if any person
or persons shall roast any cocoa,” without having
complied with certain conditions, “he, she, or they,
shall forfeit and pay for every such offense,” etc.,—a
comma appearing after <i>they</i>, although a conjunction
precedes it. But the weight of authority is against
separating the last noun or pronoun of such compound
subject from the verb when the conjunction is used.
The last quotation, above given, should read, “he,
she, or they shall forfeit,” etc.</p>
</div>

<p>23. A comma should be placed before or after a
word or phrase, to associate it with the group to
which it belongs, if, without the comma, the sentence
would be equivocal; and generally, a comma may be
inserted wherever its use will prevent ambiguity.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>This man, only cared to lay up money.</p>

<p>My communication was offered, and refused on account of
its length.</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p><span class="smcap">O<b>BS.</b></span> 21. We
recently met with this last sentence, pointed as
follows: “My communication was offered and refused, on
account of its length”; but it is not easy to see why
the length of a communication should be assigned as
the reason for having offered it.</p>
</div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>“Every favor a man receives in some measure sinks him below
his dignity.”—<i>Goldsmith.</i></p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p><span class="smcap">O<b>BS.</b></span> 22. A comma
should have been placed after <i>receives</i>.</p></div>

<p>24. No comma is put between two words or phrases
in apposition, following the verbs <i>think</i>, <i>name</i>, <i>make</i>,
<i>consider</i>, and others of a similar meaning.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>They made him their ruler.</p>

<p>They called him captain.</p>

<p>They saluted him king.</p>

<p>I esteem you my friend.</p>

<p>We constituted our Secretary a depositary of German books.</p>

<p>I consider him a gentleman.</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p><span class="smcap">O<b>BS.</b></span> 23. Of the
terms in apposition, one is the subject, and the other
the predicate, of <i>to be</i>, understood (“They made him
<i>to be</i> their ruler”). The rule might, therefore, be
worded thus: When, of two terms in apposition, one is
predicated of the other, no comma is required.</p>
</div>

<p>25. In a compound sentence, the comma is often
inserted where a verb is omitted.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>In literature, our taste will be discovered by that which we

<p><span class="smcap">O<b>BS.</b></span> 24. But
sometimes the comma is not inserted: especially when
the style is lively; when the clauses have a common
relation to something that follows; or when they are
connected by a conjunction.</p></div>

<p>The boat was tight, the day fine, the bait tempting, and the

<p>26. A short quotation, a remarkable expression, or
a short observation somewhat in manner of a quotation,
is set off by the comma.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>Plutarch calls lying, the vice of slaves.</p>

<p>The old proverb, “Too much freedery breeds despise,” is
now rendered, “Familiarity breeds contempt.”</p></div>

<div class="dobsn"><p><span class="smcap">O<b>BS.</b></span> 25. When
the introductory clause is short, the comma may be
omitted; as “Charles Fox said that restorations are
the most bloody of all revolutions.”—“Madame de Staël
admits that she discovered, as she grew old, the men
could not find out that wit in her at fifty, which
she possessed at twenty-five.” <span class="xxpn"
id="p111">{p111}</span></p></div>

<p>27. Numbers are divided by the comma into
periods of three figures each.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>The distance of the sun from the earth is usually stated at
95,000,000 miles.</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p><span class="smcap">O<b>BS.</b></span> 26. In a
number expressing the year of an era, the comma is
not used; as, July 4, 1876. In tabular work it is
very neat and convenient to omit the comma, as in the
following example:</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>The number of letters in 1600 lbs. of Pica is as follows:</p></div>

<div class="dtablebox">

<div class="dobsn">
<p><span class="smcap">O<b>BS.</b></span> 27. In
some offices the style requires all numbers less
than 1,000 to be expressed in words; 1,000 and
upwards in figures. Some printers insert the comma
before hundreds, only when five figures or more
occur.</p></div>

<p>28. Restrictive phrases or clauses are not set off
by the comma.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">

Adjective elements which are simply descriptive, and

<div class="dobsn">
<p><span class="smcap">O<b>BS.</b></span> 29. When
several distinct questions occur in succession, the
practice of some writers is to separate them by commas
or semicolons, placing the question-mark at the close
only; as:</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>“Where was Lane then; what was his situation?”—<i>Trial of
Selfridge.</i></p>

<p>“Am I Dromio, am I your man, am I myself?”</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>This we regard as incorrect. Each several question should have
the in­ter­ro­ga­tion point.</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p><span class="smcap">O<b>BS.</b></span> 30.
If several questions in one sentence are joined
by connectives, each question takes the note of
in­ter­ro­ga­tion. “Have I not all their letters to meet
me in arms by the ninth of the next month? and are
they not, some of them, set forward already?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O<b>BS.</b></span> 31. When
a sentence contains several interrogative clauses,
having a common relation to, or dependence on, one

<h4>VI. THE NOTE OE EXCLAMATION.</h4>

<p>30. The note of Exclamation is applied to expressions
of sudden or violent emotion; such as surprise,
grief, joy, love, hatred, etc.</p>

to know what <span class="xxpn" id="p114">{p114}</span>
she ought to do, in order to gain Paradise,—“My good lady,”

never get to Paradise!” returned the matron in
a fury. “Never!” says he, “for they grow young by the
way!”</p>

<div class="section">
<h4>VII. THE DASH.</h4>

<p>33. The Dash is used where a sentence breaks off
abruptly.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p><span class="spwdspb"><i>Charles.</i> You</span> must invent some ingenious subterfuge—some—some
kind <span class="nowrap">of—</span></p>

<p><span class="spwdspb"><i>Project.</i> I</span> understand; not a <i>suggestio falsi</i>, but a mild <i>suppressio
veri</i>. <span class="xxpn" id="p115">{p115}</span></p>

<p><span class="spwdspb"><i>Charles.</i> Oh,</span> is that what you call it? There is a shorter
<span class="nowrap">word—</span></p>

<p><span class="spwdspb"><i>Project.</i> There</span> is;
but it is not professional.</p>

<p>I shall divide the subject into fifteen heads, and then I shall
argue thus—but, not to give you and myself the spleen, be
contented at present with an Indian tale.</p></div>

<p>34. The dash is used before and after a parenthetic
clause, when not closely enough connected to
admit the comma.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>But it remains—and the thought is not without its comforting
significance, however hardly it may bear on individual
cases—that no bestowal of bounty, no cultivation of the amenities
of life, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. can wipe out the remembrance of even
doubtful loyalty in the day of trial.</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p><span class="smcap">O<b>BS.</b></span> 32. If
a parenthetic clause is inserted where a comma is
required in the principal sentence, a comma should
be placed before each of the dashes inclosing such
clause. (<i>See</i> last paragraph on p.
<a href="#p090" title="to &#x70;age 90">90</a>).</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>I should like to undertake the Stonyshire side of that estate,—it’s
in a dismal condition,—and set improvements on foot.</p></div>

<p>35. Several clauses having a common dependence,
are separated by a comma and a dash from the clause
on which they depend.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>To think that we have mastered the whole problem of
existence; that we have discovered the secret of creation; that
we have solved the problem of evil, and abolished mystery
from nature and religion and life,—leads naturally to a precipitation
of action, a summary dealing with evils, etc. (<i>See</i>
Example and Obs. under Rule 7.)</p></div>

<p>36. The dash is used with the comma, the semicolon,
and the colon, which it lengthens, or renders
more emphatic. <span class="xxpn" id="p116">{p116}</span></p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>We read of “merry England”;—when England was not
merry, things were not going well with it. We hear of “the
glory of hospitality,” England’s pre-eminent boast,—by the
rules of which all tables, from the table of the twenty-shilling
freeholder to the table in the baron’s hall and abbey refectory,
were open at the dinner-hour to all comers.—<i>Froude.</i></p>

<p><i>Matricaria</i>, <span class="spwdspa"><i>n.</i> A</span>
genus of plants, including the feverfew, or wild
camomile;—so called from the supposed value of some
species as remedies for certain disorders.—<i>Webster’s
Dictionary.</i></p>

<p>They did it without being at all influenced by the Anabaptists
of the continent:—the examples of some of these had
rather kept them together.—<i>D’Aubigne.</i></p></div>

<p>37. When words are too closely connected to
admit a strictly grammatical point, the dash is
used to denote a pause.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpp12">My hopes and fears</div>
<div class="dpp02">Start up alarmed, and o’er life’s narrow verge</div>
<div class="dpp02">Look down—on what? A fathomless abyss.</div>
</div></div>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpp00">The king of France, with twice ten thousand men,</div>
<div class="dpp00">Marched up the hill, and then—marched down again.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>38. When a word or phrase is repeated emphatically,
or <i>echoed</i>, it is preceded by the dash.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>The immediate question is upon the rejection of the President’s
message. It has been moved to reject it,—to reject it,
not after it was considered, but before it was considered!</p>

<p>The world continues to attach a peculiar
significance to certain names,—a significance which
at once recurs to one on hearing the isolated name
unapplied to any individual.</p></div>

<p>39. An equivalent expression, or an idea repeated
in different words, is properly set off by the comma
and dash. <span class="xxpn" id="p117">{p117}</span></p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>These are detached thoughts,—memoranda for future use.</p>

<p>Wolsey’s return to power was discussed openly as a probability,—a
result which Anne Boleyn never ceased to fear.</p>

<p>There are three kinds of power,—wealth, strength, and
talent.</p>

<p>The value of our actions will be confirmed and established
by those two sure and sateless destroyers of all other things,—Time

<p>The present time has one advantage over every other,—it
is our own.</p>

<p>Those who submit to encroachments to-day are only preparing
for themselves greater evils for to-morrow,—humiliation
or resistance.</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p><span class="smcap">O<b>BS.</b></span> 33. In a
portion of the examples under this rule, the dash
appears to supply the place of <i>viz.</i>, or <i>namely</i>.</p></div>

<p>40. A dash placed between two numbers indicates
that the natural series between those numbers is
understood.</p>

<div class="dobsn">
<p><span class="smcap">O<b>BS.</b></span> 34. If a
writer refer to “pp. 90, 95,” he means those two pages
only; but if he cite “pp. 90–95,” the reference is to
pages 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, and 95.—In dates of the same
century, the figures denoting the century are omitted
in the second number: “He has the Farmer’s Almanac for
1810–70,—sixty-one years.” (It will be observed, that,
under this rule, the short or <i>en</i> dash is used.)</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>The style of the Government Printing Office, Washington, requires
an apostrophe to denote the elision of the centuries; as
1889–’90.</p></div>

<p>41. An Ellipsis of letters is denoted by a dash.</p>

<div class="dblockquota">
<ul>
<li>Ex-President J—ns—n.</li>
<li>King F—der—ck W——m.</li>
</ul></div>

<p>42. When a sentence is abrupted (1) to form a
heading, or (2) for a signature, or (3)
to admit a <span class="xxpn" id="p118">{p118}</span>
new paragraph, or for other purposes, a dash is used
at the break; as:</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>From the preceding tables we are now able to formulate in
concise language <span class="nowrap">the—</span></p>

<div><span class="smcap">G<b>RAND</b></span>

<div class="section">
<h4>VIII. VARIOUS MARKS USED IN WRITING AND
PRINTING.</h4>

<p>The Hyphen is used to denote the division of a<br />
word into syllables; as, <i>in-ter-dict</i>: it is placed at the<br />
end of a line (usually at the close of a syllable),<br />
when a word is not finished: and it connects the<br />
parts of a compound word; as, “At Cambridge,<br />
Cecil was present at the terrible and <i>never-to-be-for-<br />gotten</i>
battle between Cheke and Gardiner on the<br />
pronunciation of the Greek epsilon, which convulsed<br />
the academic world.” (<i>See</i> p.
<a href="#p084" title="to &#x70;age 84">84</a>, <i>et seq.</i>)</p>

<p>The Apostrophe is used to abbreviate a word; as,
<i>’tis</i> for <i>it is</i>, <i>tho’</i> for <i>though</i>, <i>don’t</i> for
<i>do not</i>. It denotes the possessive case; as, “John’s
<span class="spwdspb">hat,” “three</span> years’
<span class="spwdspb">service,” “one</span> hour’s
<span class="spwdspb">work,” “two</span> days’ <span
class="spwdspb">notice,” “Smith</span> &amp; Co.’s
<span class="spwdspb">shops,” “Brook’s</span> <span
class="spwdspb">book,” “Brooks’s</span> book.” It
appears in names; as, O’Brien; M’[Mac]Mahon. <span
class="xxpn" id="p119">{p119}</span></p>

<p>In French, no space is put after an apostrophe
denoting elision; as, “d’or”: in Italian, a space is
inserted, as, “n’ arrivi.”</p>

<p class="padtopc">A turned comma sometimes denotes
the <i>ac</i> in <i>Mac</i>; as, <span class="nowrap"><i>M<img
class="iglyphc" src="images/u02bb.png" width="17"
height="82" alt="&#x2bb;" />Donough</i>.</span></p>

<p class="padtopc">Two commas (usually turned) are often used instead
of <i>do.</i> (<i>ditto</i>).</p>

</div>

<p>Quotation marks [“&#x2008;” or
<span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyphc" src="images/u201f.png"
 width="31" height="80" alt="&#x201f;" />&#x2008;”]</span> are used to include
a copied passage. If the copied passage itself contains
a quotation, the latter is denoted by single
marks [‘&#x2008;’ or
<span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyphc" src="images/u201b.png"
 width="18" height="80" alt="&#x201b;" />&#x2008;’];</span>
as, “My father said in banter,
‘James, the notes are not correct.’ The farmer
dryly answered, ‘I dinna ken what they may be <i>noo</i>;
but they were a’ richt afore ye had your fingers in
amang ’em.’”</p>

<p class="padtopc">In some publications a little labor is saved by using
single marks for the principal quotations, and double
if there happen to be inserted ones; as in a recent
novel by Mrs. Humphrey Ward:</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>‘To plunge into the Christian period without having first
cleared the mind as to what is meant in history and literature
by “the critical method” which in history may be defined,’ etc.</p></div>

<p>The same neat style is used in Max Müller’s
Translation of Kant:</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>What Kant felt in his heart of hearts we know from some
remarks found after his death among his
papers. ‘It is <span class="xxpn" id="p120">{p120}</span>
dishonorable,’ he writes, ‘to retract or deny one’s real convictions,
but silence in a case like my own, is the duty of a subject;
and though all we say must be true, it is not our duty to declare
publicly all that is true.’—<i>Preface.</i></p></div>

<p class="padtopc">Brackets are used to inclose words omitted by a
writer or copyist; as, “Were you [on the] deck of
the steamer at the [time] of the collision?” (In the
Holy Scriptures, supplied words are put in italics:
“Because <i>they sought it</i> not by faith, but, as it were,
by the works of the law.”) Explanations inserted
in text are usually inclosed in brackets; as in the
following instance, from “The Life of Dr. Goldsmith”:
“You see, my dear Dan, how long I have
been talking about myself. [<i>Some mention of private
family affairs is here omitted.</i>] My dear sir, these
things give me real uneasiness,” etc.</p>

<p class="padtopc">Marks of Parenthesis are used to inclose a sentence,
or part of a sentence, which is inserted in another
sentence: “One Sunday morning, when her daughter
(afterwards Lady Elton) went into the kitchen, she
was surprised to find a new jack (recently ordered,
and which was constructed on the principle of going
constantly without winding up) wholly paralyzed
and useless.”</p>

<p class="padtopc">The Index
<span class="nowrap">[<img class="iglyphc" src="images/u261e.png"
 width="74" height="82" alt="&#x261e;" />]</span>
is used to draw attention to
some particular passage. Sometimes an Asterism
<span class="nowrap">[<img class="iglyphc" src="images/u2042.png"
 width="59" height="80" alt="&#x2042;" />]</span>
is used for the same purpose. Where there
are many footnotes on a page, the Index is a proper
reference mark. <span class="xxpn" id="p121">{p121}</span></p>

<p class="padtopc">The Caret <span class="nowrap">
[<img class="iglyphc" src="images/caret-large.png"
 width="87" height="95" alt="&#x2038;" />]</span>
is used in writing,
to denote the point where an interlineation is
to be inserted. It is sometimes used in printing
when the exact character of a manuscript is to be
represented,—as in “exhibits” in law work.</p>

<p class="padtopc">The Brace [<img class="iglypha"
src="images/p121braceh.png" width="197" height="98"
alt="curly bracket, horizontal" />] is used to connect
a number of words with one common term; and sometimes
in poetry, to connect three lines which rhyme
together:</p>

<div class="dblockquota">

</div>

<p class="padtopc">Marks of Ellipsis or Omission are the dash; as,
“Col. Sm—h”: or asterisks; as, “Col. Sm**h”:
or, neatest of all, points; as, “Col. Sm&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;h.”</p>

<p class="padtopc">Leaders are dots which lead the eye from something
on the left of the page, to some connected
matter on the right:</p>

<div class="dblockquota ffmono">

Co.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;London,

<li>Mutual Life In.

Conn.</li></ul></div>

<p class="padtopc">Accents are the Grave [`], the Acute [´], and
the Circumflex [<sup>&#x5e;</sup>]: è is read by the copy-holder
<i>grave e</i>; é, <i>acute e</i>; ê, <i>circumflex e</i>.</p>

<p class="padtopc">Marks of Quantity are the Long, as over <i>o</i> in
“shōw”; the Short, or Breve, as over <i>o</i> in “nŏt”;
and the Diæresis, which denotes that
the latter of <span class="xxpn" id="p122">{p122}</span>
two vowels is not in the same syllable as the former;
as, <span class="spwdspb">“zoölogy,” “Antinoüs.”</span></p>

<p class="padtopc">The Cedilla is a curve line
under the letter <i>c</i>, to denote that it has the
sound of <i>s</i>; as in <span class="spwdspb">“garçon,”
“façade.”</span> It appears in words from the
French language. Worcester uses it also to denote
the soft sounds of <i>g</i>, <i>s</i>, and <i>x</i>; as in <span
class="spwdspb">“mişle,”
<span class="nowrap">“e<img class="iglyphc" src="images/u0078u0327.png"
 width="38" height="82" alt="&#x0078;&#x0327;" />aģģerate.”</span></span>
Webster uses it only to denote the soft sound
of <i>c</i>, as in “min-çing-ly.” We remark here, by
the way, that in dividing such words as <span
class="spwdspb">“bra-cing,” “min-cing,”</span>
“convin-cing,” etc., the <i>c</i> should be carried over,
thereby preserving its proper sound. For a similar
reason divide <span class="spwdspb">“enga-ging,”
“ra-ging,”</span> etc., on the <i>a</i>. Whether
“ma-gis-trate” should follow this rule is a matter of
style. There are offices which so divide it, while
others divide on the <i>g</i>. We prefer to syllable the
word as we have written it,—on the <i>a</i>.</p>

<p class="padtopc">The Spanish ñ has the sound of <i>n</i> in <i>onion</i>; as,
<span class="spwdspb">“Señor,” “cañon.”</span></p>

<p class="padtopc">Umlaut (pron. ōōmlowt), as defined by Webster,
is the change or modification of a vowel sound, peculiar
to the Germanic languages; as in German, <i>Mann</i>,
man, <i>Männer</i> or <i>Maenner</i>, men. The name <i>Roelker</i>
may also be written <i>Rölker</i>.</p>

<p class="padtopc">¶ denotes the beginning of a
paragraph, as may be noticed in the Sacred Scriptures.
In proof-reading and in manuscript, it is used to
denote where a paragraph or break should be made.
<span class="xxpn" id="p123">{p123}</span></p>

<p class="padtopc">§ denotes a section; §§, sections; as, Gen. Stat.,
Chap. IX., § 19, and Chap. X., §§ 20 and 21.</p>

<p class="padtopc">Reference to notes at the bottom
of the page (commonly termed footnotes) is usually
made by the asterisk, *, the obelisk, or dagger, †;
the double obelisk, or double dagger, ‡; the section,
§; the parallels,
<span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyphc" src="images/u2016.png"
 width="18" height="80" alt="&#x2016;" />;</span>
the paragraph, ¶; and the index,
<span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyphc" src="images/u261e.png"
 width="74" height="82" alt="&#x261e;" />;</span>—but
a neater mode is to use superiors; as, <sup>1,
2, 3,</sup> or <sup>a, b, c,</sup> commencing with
<sup>1</sup> or <sup>a</sup> on each page where notes
occur.</p>

<p class="padtopc">In concluding our chapter on punctuation, we
venture to say to our friends at the case, that, in our
opinion, no system of pointing can be of uniform and
universal application. Men differ as much in style
of writing as in personal appearance, and we might
as well expect the same robe to fit all forms, as that
one set of rules shall nicely apply to the endless
diversities of diction.</p>

<p>Other things being equal however, he who has paid
most attention to rule will punctuate with the nearest
approximation to correctness. With a clear understanding
of an author’s meaning, the compositor
seldom need go far astray; and if, having done his
best, he finds any passage hopelessly involved, or the
meaning too subtile to be grasped, he has one safe
resource,—and that is, to <span class="smmaj">FOLLOW</span>
<span class="smmaj">THE</span>
<span class="smmaj">COPY</span> closely
and mechanically. Could he have for reference a
few pages preceding a doubtful passage, the whole
matter might become perfectly clear; but, as that is
out of the question, those pages
being scattered as <span class="xxpn" id="p124">{p124}</span>
“takes” in other hands, let the compositor adopt the
safe course,—FOLLOW COPY,—resting assured
that no person whose opinion he need value, could
possibly think of finding fault with him for leaving
responsibility where
it properly belongs.</p></div><!--section-->

<div class="section" id="p125">
<h2 class="h2herein">CHAPTER VI.
<span class="hsmall">ORTHOGRAPHY.</span></h2>

<p class="pfirst">Webster defines Orthography as “the art of
writing words with the proper letters, according to
common usage”; Worcester, as “the art or the
mode of spelling words.” They agree in this: that
there are some words—two or three thousand, perhaps—whose
orthography common usage has not
settled. Prefixed to either Dictionary is a list showing
in double column the most prevalent methods of
spelling words of doubtful orthography; thus:</p>

<div class="dblockquota">
<table summary="">
<tr>
 <td class="tdlefta">Abettor</td>
 <td class="tdleft">Abetter</td></tr>

 <td class="tdleft">Scalade</td></tr>
<tr>
 <td class="tdlefta">Germane</td>
 <td class="tdleft">Germain, German</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The first column in the Webster List “presents
the orthography recognized in the body of [the]
Dictionary as the preferable one, or that in general
use.” But “when in this list the word in the first
column is followed by <i>or</i>, as ‘Abatis, <i>or</i> Abattis,’ it is
implied that the second form is nearly, often quite, in
as good use as the first.” When the word in the
first column differs in meaning from that in the
second, the word in the first is followed by <i>and</i>, as
‘Lunet, <i>and Lunette</i>,’ both words being in use, but
applied to different things. <span class="xxpn" id="p126">{p126}</span></p>

<p>The orthography in the first column of the Worcester
List “is deemed to be well authorized, and in
most cases preferable; but with respect to the authority
of that in the right-hand column, there is a great
diversity. Both orthographies of some of the words
are right, the words being differently spelled when
used in different senses”; as, “Draught, <i>or</i> <span class="spwdspb">Draft,”
“Subtle,</span> <i>or</i> Subtile,” etc. Sometimes <i>and</i> is used as
the connective; as, “Canvas, <i>and</i> Canvass.” But
these double arrangements are of almost no service
to the proof-reader or compositor,—for the interchangeable
words cannot <i>both</i> be inserted in his work.
If he could use the various spellings, it would save
the trouble of weighing authorities: we should then
have such sentences as these:</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>The hostler <i>or</i> ostler inveigled <i>or</i> enveigled
the horses into the stockade <i>or</i> stoccade. Meanwhile
the infantry landed at the jettee <i>or</i> jetty <i>or</i>
jetta <i>or</i> jutty, and at once constructed an abatis
<i>or</i> abattis <i>or</i> abbatis, as it behooved <i>or</i> behoved
them.</p></div>

<p>Of these various correct spellings, <i>one</i> must be
selected to the exclusion of the rest. But there
being no common usage, no academy to instruct, and
the copy not being uniform, who or what is to guide
the printers and proof-readers in making the selection?
“For the last eighty years [or more], printers
have exercised a general control over English orthography,”—and
we, to carry the general control a little
farther, propose to set forth for general use one list
from Webster’s first column, exhibiting only <i>one</i>
single correct spelling, to be used where the Webster
style prevails; and a similar
list from Worcester’s <span class="xxpn" id="p127">{p127}</span>
first column, to be used where the Worcester style has
the precedence. Would there were a <i>Smithsonian
Bureau of the English Language</i>, to render <i>two</i> lists
unnecessary; and to give <i>one</i> style to Government
work,—a style which should have the approval of
Congress, and to which all printing done by or for
the various Departments of the United States Government
should be conformed.</p>

<div class="section">
<p>There is a large class of words
ending either in <i>able</i> or <i>ible</i>, amounting to
more than sixteen hundred. For these we know of no
general rule which can be given, that would readily
indicate the proper termination. In practice, writers
and printers, with rare exceptions, are obliged at
times to depend on something besides memory to secure
correctness; and if the dictionary is not at hand, the
wrong termination may—as in fact it often does—get
into print. So excellent a work as “The American First
Class Book” prints an extract from Webster’s Plymouth
oration thus:</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>If any practices exist, contrary to the principles of justice
and humanity, within the reach of our laws or our influence,
we are inexcus<i>i</i>ble if we do not exert ourselves to restrain and
abolish them. <span class="xxpn" id="p155">{p155}</span></p></div>

<p>And in a periodical which is sent broadcast over
the United States, occurs the following paragraph
(April 24, 1888), copied from a report made by
Henry Clay in 1838:</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>That authors and inventors have, according to the practice
among civilized nations, a property in the respective productions
of their genius is incontest<i>i</i>ble, etc.</p></div>

<p>We append below, for convenient reference, a catalogue
of the words referred to, including (1) those
in present use; (2) those that are rare; and (3)
the obsolete. The latter often occur in reprints, and
are sometimes resuscitated or galvanized for a present
purpose,—as, for instance, in a recent popular novel,
of wide circulation, there occurs three or more times,
the word “ineluctable,” denoted by Webster as obsolete.
We may have omitted some words that should
have been inserted, but believe we have accomplished
our object within very negligible limits of error.</p>

<p>A word in parenthesis indicates a various mode of
spelling the word immediately preceding.</p>

<p>Errors sometimes occur in forming

a consonant precede the final <i>o</i>, add <i>es</i>; as
“archipelago, archipelagoes.” Such exceptions to the

<p>But “albugo” has <i>pl.</i> “albugines”; and to
“imago” we should probably have to write <i>pl.</i> “imagines.”
There are many nouns ending in <i>o</i>, for
whose plurals we have not found any authority beyond
the general rule. With the exceptions given
above, the rule may be safely followed. The plural

<h2 class="h2herein">CHAPTER VII.
<span class="hsmall">CAPITALIZATION.</span></h2>

<p class="pfirst">To persons who have paid no special, technical
attention to the subject, cap­i­tal­i­za­tion appears a very
simple matter. The rules are few and easily understood;
but as to the “application of them” there is
some perplexity and much diversity among authors,
printers, and proof-readers. Practically, the main
difficulty seems to arise from the want of a plain
line of demarkation between common nouns and
proper nouns! Some write and print “Pacific
Ocean” as the proper name of a certain collection
of water; others, “Pacific ocean,”—ocean being a
common noun. We may, perhaps, recur to this abstruse
matter farther on; but at present we will lay
down such rules as we have used in our own labors,
and which we deem to be correct. It will be very
convenient for us, and therefore we hope excusable,
to adopt two phrases from the expressive terminology
of the printing-office, where some words are said to
be “put up,” and others to be “put down”; e. g.:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpp00">“When Music, heavenly maid, was young.”</div>
</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">Here “Music” is said to be “put
up,” because it begins with a capital “M,” and “maid”
is “put down,” because it begins with a small “m.”
<span class="xxpn" id="p172">{p172}</span></p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpp00">“Abelard taught Eloisa music.”</div>
</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">Here <span
class="spwdspb">“Abelard,” “Eloisa”</span> are “put
up,” and “music” is “put down.”</p>

<p>This premised, understood, and forgiven, we are
ready for <span class="nowrap">the—</span></p>

<h3 class="h3a">RULES FOR THE RIGHT USE OF CAPITALS.</h3>

<p>Rule 1. The initial letter of every sentence should
be a capital.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>Yours received. Glad to hear from you. Will answer next
week.</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>Capitals, Y, G, W, as per Rule 1.</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>And Cain said unto the Lord, My punishment is greater
than I can bear.—<i>Genesis 4&#x2009;:&#x2009;13.</i></p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>Capitals, A and M; for here are two sentences, although
one is included in the other.</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>Cain said that his punishment was greater than he could
bear.</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>Capital C, by Rule 1; but the included words of Cain being
brought in obliquely, no capital is required.</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>Cicero said, “There is no moment without some duty”;
and who doubts the wisdom of Cicero?</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>C and T are put up, by Rule 1.</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>On the first day of January, Artemus Ward made this remark:
Now is a good time to <i>resoloot</i>.</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>O and N are put up, by Rule 1.</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>Few truisms are truer than this paradox of Aristotle,—To
mankind in general, the parts are greater than the whole.</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>F and T are put up, by Rule 1.</p>

<p>It has been said, that the included sentence should not be
capitalized unless immediately preceded by a
colon: but the <span class="xxpn" id="p173">{p173}</span>
above examples show, that a sentence <i>directly introduced</i>
must be capitalized, whatever point precedes it,—comma,
comma-dash, colon, or any other pause-mark.</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>He asked why he was arrested, and we replied that he was
arrested on suspicion.</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>Initial capital H, by Rule 1.</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>He asked, “Why am I arrested?” and we replied, “On
suspicion.”</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>Here are three initial capitals, and properly;
for the reply, fully expressed, would be, “You are
arrested on suspicion.”</p>

<p>So, also, captions, head-lines, side-heads, etc.,
being imperfect sentences, fall under Rule 1. The
same is true of particulars depending from a general
heading; <span class="nowrap">as—</span></p></div>

<div class="dblockquota">
<ul class="fsz6">
<li>Property destroyed by the late fire:
      <ul><li>Seventy reams elephant paper;</li>
      <li>Tables, chairs, desks;</li>
      <li>Old-fashioned hall-clock;</li>
      <li>Johnson’s Dictionary, 1st ed.</li></ul></li></ul></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>We have remarked above, on the passage from Genesis,
that a sentence introduced obliquely requires no capital. In
the following example, <i>whether Sparta should be inclosed with
walls</i> is an indirect question, and is not capitalized; while the
answer, being direct, takes a capital.</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>To the question whether Sparta should be inclosed with
walls, Lycurgus made this answer: “That city is well fortified
which has a wall of men instead of brick.”</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>Kerl’s rule (Grammar, p.
<a href="#p041" title="to &#x70;age 41">41</a>) is “Within a sentence, the
first word of any important beginning may commence with a
capital letter.” This rule is probably as precise as can be
framed to meet his first example, “<i>Resolved</i>, That our Senators
be requested, etc.” His second example, “One truth is clear:
Whatever is, is right,” falls within his rule, and our Rule 1.
(<i>See</i> page

for cap­i­tal­iz­ing, etc., preambles, resolutions,
provisos, etc.) <span class="xxpn" id="p174">{p174}</span></p>

<p>When a sentence is introduced obliquely, a capital is not
required, even if the passage introduced have quotation marks,
and make perfect sense without the introductory prefix, as in
the following example:</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>It is remarked by Parton, that “a man who retains to the
age of seventy-nine the vigor of manhood and the liveliness
of a boy, cannot, at any period of his life, have egregiously
violated the laws of his being.”</p></div>

From Esther 1&#x2009;:&#x2009;19–22 we learn that a “royal commandment”
was sent into all the king’s provinces, “that every man should
bear rule in his own house.” If any of our readers have
occasion to put in type, or read the proof of, the title of an
edict or decree, they will, of course, make it agree with the
rule. Of proclamations we have several every year. Frequently
all the letters of the titles are capitals; otherwise, the
capitals appear as in the following example:</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<div><span class="smcap">B<b>Y</b></span>
<span class="smcap">H<b>IS</b></span>
<span class="smcap">E<b>XCELLENCY,</b></span>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>In a monograph of a geological survey the following paragraph
appears:</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>The dark laminated clays of the Cretaceous passing up
into the Upper Cretaceous are well
shown .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. passing up <span class="xxpn" id="p176">{p176}</span>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>Webster says, that the Carboniferous age “embraces three
periods, the Subcarboniferous, the Carboniferous, and the
Permian,” but the Fifth Ann. Rep. U. S. Geol. Survey,
doubtless for some good reason, changes the style to the sub-Carboniferous
(<i>v.</i> remark under Rule 8, on “transatlantic,”
etc.).</p>

<p>The main subject under discussion being Woman Suffrage,
those words were properly capitalized in the following paragraph:</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>It is conceded .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that the avowal even, of faith in the
principle of Woman Suffrage, would handicap the party most
seriously.</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>In accordance with Rule 3 was this direction touching a
Report on Education:</p>

<p>Spell “report” with capital R, when it refers to this Report;
l. c. [lower-case] in other cases.</p>

<p>Presidential, imperial, kingly, ducal, etc., titles are put
down when used generally, but are put up when applied to
persons. In the following example “<i>an</i> emperor” is down,
while “<i>the</i> Emperor” is put up.</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>The events which now took place in the interior of Germany
were such as usually happened when either the throne was
without an emperor, or the Emperor without a sense of his
imperial dignity.—<i>Schiller’s Thirty Years’ War.</i></p>

<p>Beginning with President Washington and including President
Harrison, the United States has had twenty-three presidents.</p></div>

<p class="padtopc">4. Names and appellations of the
Supreme Being should be capitalized.</p>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>We forbear inserting a list of the sacred names,
too often written and uttered “in vain.” The reader is
probably <span class="xxpn" id="p177">{p177}</span>
familiar with them from listening to Sabbath
services, and reading religious books with which, we
hope, his library abounds.</p>

<p>The word “providence” should be put down or up,
according to its meaning, as may be seen in the two
following sentences:</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>But behold now another providence of God; a ship came
into the harbor. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This ship had store of English beads
and some knives.—<i>New England’s Memorial.</i></p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpp00">The world was all before them, where to choose</div>
<div class="dpp00">Their place of rest, and Providence

</div></div></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>Nouns ordinarily common become proper when written as
names of the Supreme Being.</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>I hope my merciful Judge will bear in mind my heavy punishment
on earth.—<i>Pickwick Papers</i>, ch. 44.</p>

<p>Emerson refers “all productions at last to an aboriginal
Power.”—<i>Century Maga.</i></p>

<p>Plato said, that in all nations certain minds dwell
on the “fundamental Unity,” and “lose all being in one
Being.”—<i>Ib.</i></p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>In the above examples, the effect of capitals
in conveying the idea of personality is strikingly
illustrated.</p>

<p>Pronouns referring to the Deity are not
usually put up,—excepting the personals <span
class="spwdspb">“He,” “Him.”</span></p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>O thou, whose justice reigns on high.—<i>Watts.</i></p>

<p>O thou, Most High—<i>Ps.</i> 56&#x2009;:&#x2009;2.</p>

<p>Father of all mercies, we, thine unworthy servants,
do give thee most humble and hearty thanks for all thy
goodness.—<i>Common Prayer.</i></p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p><i>Thou</i>, <i>whose</i>, <i>thine</i>, <i>thy</i>, properly
lower-case.</p>

<p>Usage is ununiform as to cap­i­tal­iz­ing the pronoun of the
third person, when referring to the Deity; some using the
capital in all three cases (He, His, Him), while others capitalize
the nominative and objective, and put “his” down; and still
others put all the cases down.</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>God does love us. As any loving father or mother, He
wants us to want His society, and to love to be with and talk
with Him.—<i>Congregationalist.</i></p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>Small letter in the possessive, capital in

<p class="psignature"><i>Dick. Improv’t Soc.</i> § VI.</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>All the cases down:</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">

upon his own gracious promise, etc.—<i>Rev. John
Newton’s Sermon on the “happy recovery” of King George
(modern reprint).</i></p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>But, whatever the style of the office, there is one category
in which the personal pronoun must be capitalized: it is when
no antecedent is expressed. Such cases are not of infrequent
occurrence. If one were to <span class="nowrap">write—</span></p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>In all her troubles this good lady never failed to express
her confidence in the care of him in whom she had put her
<span class="nowrap">trust—</span></p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p class="pcontinue">the meaning would be doubtful;
“him” might refer to some humane relative, or to the
superintendent of the almshouse. But if the sentence
were <span class="nowrap">written—</span></p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>&#x2e;&nbsp;&#x2e;&nbsp;&#x2e; this good lady never

whom, <span class="nowrap">etc.—</span></p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p class="pcontinue">the meaning—that the Deity is
intended—becomes clear.</p>

<p>Adjuncts qualifying names applied to Deity usually require
no capitals:</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>For when we consider ourselves as the creatures of God
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what can induce us to love, fear, and trust Him, as our

<p class="psignature"><i>Mason’s
Self-Knowledge.</i></p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>Here “all-sufficient” is properly put down; as are also
“great” and “common” in the following paragraph:</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>Not only honor and justice, and what I owe
to man is my interest; but gratitude also,
acquiescence, resignation, adoration, and all I
owe to this great polity, and its great Governor
our common Parent.—<i>Harris.</i> <span class="xxpn"
id="p179">{p179}</span></p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>But many cases occur where the adjective is properly put
up; especially if the adjective itself denotes sacredness, as the
following examples show:</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>Klopstock .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. suffers himself to forget
that the [French] revolution itself is a process of
the Divine <span class="nowrap">Providence.—</span></p>

<p class="psignature"><i>Coleridge Biog. Lit.</i></p>

<p>Among the greater number of pagan nations, the most
absurd and grovelling notions are entertained respecting the
Supreme Intelligence, and the nature of that worship which
his perfections demand.—<i>Dick.</i></p>

<p>We are apt to entertain narrow conceptions of the Divine
Nature.—<i>Addison.</i></p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>The words “Christian” and “Christianity” the
best usage puts up; nor does there seem to be any
good reason why “christianize” should not also be
capitalized.</p>

<p>There are instances where the word “divine,” though
referring to sacred personages, should not be put up;
<span class="nowrap">as—</span></p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>If Christ did not hold this key, how is He <span

<p class="psignature spitalic">Congregationalist.</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>The words <span class="spwdspb">“godly,”
“godfather,” “godmother”</span> are put down: Webster
has “godspeed,” and says it is “written also as two
separate words, as in 2 John 10.” Worcester does
not admit the phrase as one word in his defining
columns, but prints it as two, under the word “God”;
quoting the same text as Webster. The Congressional
Record, 50th Congress, uses capital and hyphen,
thus: “God-speed”; and this form is adopted by Abbot
Bassett, the talented editor of the L. A. W. Bulletin,
in his Farewell to former Chief Consul Hayes:</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpp00">Take now the hand we so often have shaken,</div>

<div class="dpp01">Give him a hearty God-speed and adieu.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p class="pcontinue">Still Webster’s style of one
word, lower-case, is, we think, preferable, and most
used.</p>

<p>The word “gospel” when used generally,—in the sense
of good tidings,—should be down; as “Woe is me, if I
<span class="xxpn" id="p180">{p180}</span> preach not
the gospel.” But when used as part of a title to a
specific book, it goes up; as “The Gospel according to
St. Matthew”; “The Apocryphal Gospel of St. Thomas”;
“The Gospel of St. Luke.”</p></div>

<p class="padtopc">5. Names of ancient Greek and Roman divinities,
and of all pagan and heathen gods, should be put up.</p>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>When the word “god” or “goddess” is applied to a
paganic divinity, it is put down. This remark and
our Rule 5 are both exemplified in Darwin’s <span

<div class="dblockquot">
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">

<div class="dobsn">
<p>So, also, 1 Kings 11&#x2009;:&#x2009;33:</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>Worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh
the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children

<div class="dobsn">
<p>The names applied to evil spirits should be put
up:</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>And Satan came also among them.—<i>Job</i> 1&#x2009;:&#x2009;6.</p>

<p>Then Apollyon said unto Christian, “Here will I spill thy

<p>During a violent thunderstorm, the converted Chinese steward
disappeared. The captain found him below, making prostrations
before a gilded image. “How is this?” demanded the
astonished captain; “I thought you were a Christian.” The
Chinaman replied, “Your God velly well, fine weather;
stolm like this, want Joss.”</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>In the above example, the objects of Christian and pagan
worship are properly capitalized.</p>

<p>From the foregoing remarks, etc., especially under Rule 4,
it will be perceived that cap­i­tal­i­za­tion is, in the department of
theology as in all others, mostly regulated by office style.
But in forming a style, the above rules and examples may be
found serviceable.</p></div>

<p class="padtopc">6. The pronoun I, and the
interjection O, should always be put up. <span
class="xxpn" id="p181">{p181}</span></p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>I scarcely knew how long I had sat there when I became
aware of a recognition.</p>

<p>Praise the Lord, O my soul.—<i>Ps.</i> cxlvi.</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>But in Latin the “O” is frequently put down.</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>Huc ades, ô formosa puer.—<i>Virgil.</i></p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpp00">Adestes o Maria, o Angele, o Patroni castitatis meæ.—</div>
</div>
<div class="dpoemcite">
<i>Libellus Precum, Georgiopoli, D.C.</i></div></div>
</div>

<p class="padtopc">7. Some words which are put down when spelled
in full, are put up when contracted.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>The Dr. called upon me. Need I say, I regretted the happiness
of seeing the doctor?</p>

<p>“Patent-office, number 16” may be written, “Patent-office,

<p>The honorable the Secretary of the Navy.</p>

<p>The Hon. the Secretary of the Navy.</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>But certain suffixes, whether spelled in full or contracted,
are put up or down, or in small caps, capitalized, according to
the style of the words to which they are suffixed; as, for
instance, the words “junior” and “esquire,” which are put
one degree less in dignity than the words to which they are
attached; as:</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>John Smith, jr., esq., [or “junior, esquire.”]</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>The person’s name being lower-case capitalized, “jr.” and
“esq.” are put down.</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">J<b>OHN</b></span>
<span class="smcap">D<b>OE</b>,</span> Jr. Esq., [or “Junior, Esquire.”]</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>The names being small caps, capitalized, the “jr.” and
“esq.” are put up.</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>RICHARD ROE, <span class="smcap">J<b>R.</b></span>
<span class="smcap">E<b>SQ.</b>,</span> [or “<span class="smcap">J<b>UNIOR,</b></span>
<span class="smcap">E<b>SQUIRE</b>.”]</span></p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>The names being in capitals, the suffixes are capitals and
small capitals.</p>

<p>But <span class="spwdspb">“D.D.” “LL.D.”
“M.D.”</span> etc., are put in large or small capitals
according to office style, or a style adapted for the
work in which they appear: as— <span class="xxpn"
id="p182">{p182}</span></p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>John Doe, LL.D.; <span class="smcap">R<b>ICHARD</b></span>

<span class="smcap">P<b>H.D.</b>;</span> J. SMITH,
<span class="nowrap"><span class="smmaj">M.D.</span>;</span>
ABEL MONEY, F.R.S.</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>Words connected with a number of designation are often
put up,—and this is the better way. So, though the words
<span class="spwdspb">“Bay,” “Dock,”</span> etc., in the following examples may properly
be put down if the office style require it, yet the unfettered
compositor and reader will prefer to put up those, and all
words similarly placed; as:</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>The planks of Bay No. 6 on Chelsea Bridge have been replaced
by ordinary boards purchased at Dock No. 8.</p>

<p>We arrived at Station 16, and proceeded thence through
Lock 12 to Dam No. 8.</p></div>

<p class="padtopc">8. Names of persons, of things
personified, of nations, countries, cities, towns,
streets, ships, etc., should be put up.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>Capt. Samuel Jones sailed in ship Minerva, from Sandy
Hook to Tanjong Bolus, the most southerly point of the continent
of Asia.</p>

<p>A charming and <i>spirituelle</i> Frenchwoman said of
Julius Mohl, that Nature, in forming his character,
had skimmed the cream of the three nationalities

a Frenchman, and loyal as an Englishman.”—<i>Atlantic
Monthly.</i></p>

<p>Charles, Susan, William, Henrietta Matilda, Benjamin
Harrison Smith, come in, this minute!</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>Under this rule proper adjectives may also be classed; as:</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>The French and American Claims Commission.</p>

<p>He is familiar with the German, French, Russian, Bengalee,
Chinese, and Grebo languages.</p>

<p>Is the Monroe doctrine heartily concurred in by European
nations?</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>Names of political parties should be put up.</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>Democrat, Democratic, Democracy, Republican, Republicanism,
Woman-Suffragists, Women’s Rights party, Locofocos,
Whigs, Tories, Free-Soilers, Liberals, Independents, etc. <span class="xxpn" id="p183">{p183}</span></p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>But when any of these words are used in a general sense,
they should be put down; as:</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>Whatever requires to be done by slow and cautious degrees
does not accord with the spirit of democracy.—<i>De Staël.</i></p>

<p>The tendency of some European nations is toward republicanism.</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>The words “state” and “territory” applied to political
divisions of the United States should be put up; as:</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>The State of North Dakota. The Territory of Utah.</p>

<p>This State gave a Republican majority.</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>Some nouns and adjectives originally proper have, by usage,
the common form; as:</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>We sell silver, china, and iron wares.</p>

<p>There is great demand for india-rubber goods.</p>

<p>His pets are guinea-pigs and guinea-hens.</p>

<p>That maltese cat follows her everywhere.</p>

<p>He wears russia-leather boots, morocco gaiters, and a fez
cap when dancing the german.</p>

<p>The burglars secured six german silver spoons.</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>Numbers are denoted by roman capitals or arabic figures.</p>

<p>There are some words yet on debatable ground. It is safe
to write “plaster of Paris” or “plaster of paris.” The latter
form is well enough for so common an article, and should be
preferred by compositors.</p>

<p>Some words which are put up when alone, are put down
when they coalesce with a preposition; as:</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>I crossed the Atlantic to view transatlantic countries.</p>

<p>The transpacific people are apt merchants.</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>But some write <span class="spwdspb">“inter-State,”
“cis-Platine,” “trans-Atlantic,” “cis-Padane,”
“cis-Alpine,”</span> etc. We know of no good authority
for such work. It has no countenance from our
lex­i­cog­raphers: and the hyphen and capital in the
middle of the words are needless deformities.</p></div>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p><span class="smcap">N<b>OTE.</b></span> The “etc.”
in Rule 7 is like one spoken of by Coke (an “etc.” of
Littleton, I am told), “full of <span class="xxpn"
id="p184">{p184}</span> excellent meaning.” Descending
from the name of a continent to the designations <span
class="spwdspb">“beat,” “precinct,” “alley”;</span>
or ascending from <span class="spwdspb">“wharf,”
“alley”</span> to the name of a continent, through
lessening or increasing subdivisions, the line must
be drawn <i>somewhere</i> between what is to be put up
and what is to be put down. Just where the line
is drawn between capital and lower-case initials,
between the aristocrats of the page and <i>hoi polloi</i>,
is of very little consequence; but as uniformity in
a work is desirable while proof-readers are liable
to differ, it is as important to have an umpire in
a proof-room as it is on a base-ball ground. And
as cap­i­tal­i­za­tion is wholly arbitrary, the
essential qualities of an umpire are, that he shall
have a good memory, so as not to overset to-day the
decisions of yesterday, and a strong will of his own,
which shall not allow any obstinate reader to step
across the important imaginary line which separates
the <i>ups</i> from the <i>downs</i>,—the majuscules from the
minuscules.</p>

<p>If a printing-office requires the services of but one
reader, he, happy man, can suit himself, even though
reasonably sure that he will suit nobody else—so various
and set are the opinions of men on matters of trifling
moment. If, however, two readers are employed,
and on the same work, the one with the best judgment
should be allowed to decide all doubtful points; but in
this case, as in matrimonial life, the question as to
which has the best judgment, is usually decided, if not
by the strongest will, by the will of the party most reckless
of consequences. But in proof-reading, any point
in dispute is usually so trifling, that the readers can call
in the office-boy, technically called printer’s —— but
we were once youngest apprentice ourself, and choose to
forget the word,—and let him settle it; whereas, in
matrimonial life it is a different Agency with a similar
name who is generally called in, and “by decision more
embroils the fray.” <span class="xxpn" id="p185">{p185}</span></p>

<p>To show the absurdity of supposing that good readers
will not differ in the use of capitals, we once wrote a
paragraph, and gave an exact copy to each of two
skilled proof-readers, desiring them to capitalize it as
they thought it should be capitalized if about to go to
press. We will here give the paragraph as we wrote it—without
regard to rules—and then exhibit their corrections,
etc., in parallel columns:</p>

called Poplar Square; an avenue, known as Chestnut
avenue, connects that square with Washington street;
and Washington street is a thoroughfare connecting
Snowhill division of Junction City with the city of
Boomerang, the capital of the State of Cherokee—a
State just admitted to the Union, and to all the
privileges of this happy nation, the United States
of America—the foremost republic of the Western
Hemisphere.</td></tr></table>

<div class="section">
<p id="p186">One of these styles may be just as good as the other
(see chapter on “Style”); but whichever were selected,
should be strictly adhered to, through the whole book or
work to which it was deemed applicable. Had the above
paragraph been given to still a third reader, very likely
he would have capitalized “Division,” as being of more
consequence than a beat or a ward; another would have
deemed “Precinct” worthy of being put up, while
“beat” would have been placed in the small-letter
obscurity of “wharf” and “alley.” Another would
say that localities designated by a number should
always be put up; as “Beat <span class="spwdspb">6,” “Station</span> A” (See
closing remark and examples, under Rule 7). The
words “street” and “avenue” are left down by both
the above readers. The <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> puts those
words up,—“The junction of Beacon Street and Brookline
Avenue”; the <i>Century</i> magazine has “Canal
street, its former upper boundary”; <i>Harper’s Maga.</i>
speaks of “the old house in St. Louis Street in which,”
etc. Each office makes its own style.</p>

<p>The word “city” in “Junction City” is put up,—the
<i>two</i> words forming the city’s name. Whether to
print “New York City” or “New York city” is a
moot point,—at present a matter of style. Some
insist that as <i>ocean</i>, <i>sea</i>, <i>city</i>, <i>street</i>, etc., are common
nouns, they so remain when connected with a proper
adjective, and should be put down,—and from this
starting-point they have endeavored to frame a general,
and at the same time practical, rule for cap­i­tal­iz­ing
common nouns, which, when described by proper adjectives,
form parts of individual names. But, judging
from our experience in proof-reading, the endeavor has
thus far been unsuccessful. The
adjective, the <span class="xxpn" id="p187">{p187}</span>
dis­tin­guish­ing word, always begins with a capital; as in
“Bristol <span class="spwdspb">county,” “Atlantic</span> ocean.” The rule then,
formulated, amounts to this: “Put the dis­tin­guish­ing
word up, and the class name down.” But usage will
not allow this; we must not write “Long <span class="spwdspb">island,”
“James</span> smith,”—wherefore the rule has this qualification:
“If the dis­tin­guish­ing word alone <i>does not
clearly designate the object</i>, both words must be put
up.” This qualification virtually annuls the rule,—for
different minds have different opinions as to whether
the object is, or is not, “clearly designated.” Reader A
writes “Poplar square,” while Reader B writes “Poplar
Square.” Under the rule and qualification, mentioned
above, we have set before us, as correct examples,
“Hudson river, Red River”; as if the significance of
such prefixes as “red, swift, narrow, deep,” could not be
determined by the insertion or omission of the article <i>a</i>,
of which we shall speak farther on,—but must be made
by cap­i­tal­iz­ing “river.” But admitting that the cap­i­tal­iz­ing
of “River” more clearly designates the object, we
doubt whether any printer or reader would wittingly
pass one “river” down, and another “River” up, in the
same work; and the average writer and reader for the
press can hardly be supposed to take much time to study
whether a given river or city or square is just within or
outside of the limit of “clear designation.” Among the
proof-readers of a certain large work on geography,
which seems to have been carefully read, there must
have been some difference of opinion on this point; for
it speaks of “the bay of Biscay” and “the Gulf of
Mexico”; and the “Atlantic ocean” of Vol. 1, becomes
the “Atlantic Ocean” of Vol. 2. And such discrepancies
must appear in every work which is
printed under <span class="xxpn" id="p188">{p188}</span>
the rule “Put the object down and the dis­tin­guish­ing
word up—<i>with exceptions</i>,” unless the exceptions are
mentioned individually, seriatim, and a list of the same
given to all employees who are expected to set type and
read proof under such rule.</p>

<p>The objection to putting the class name down, is not
so much that the dis­tin­guish­ing word alone ever fails to
“clearly designate the object,” as that usage in many
instances, and a sense of personal dignity in others, prevent
all family and many other class names from sinking
into lower-case. It were—there being no usage in its
favor—a shame to print “Andrew Jackson” with a
little “j,” although the dis­tin­guish­ing word “Andrew”
would clearly designate the individual intended. “We
sailed past Long island” could not possibly be mistaken
for “We sailed past a long island.” In conversation
the mere omission of the article <i>a</i> would clearly indicate
that we had a particular island in view, and what island
it was, even if we were not to inform an interlocutor,
that, were we to print our remark we should capitalize
the “L,” and very possibly the “I.”</p>

<p>“We sailed on <i>a</i> red river,”—it may have been
the Raritan, or any other river running among iron
ore; or it may have been any one of the twelve
streams of the United States which bear each the name
“Red river”; the article <i>a</i>, as Murray observes,
“determines the object spoken of to be one single
thing of a kind, leaving it still uncertain <span
class="spwdspb">which.” “It</span> is,” says Murray
further, “an excellence of the English language,”
that, “by means of its two articles it does <i>most
precisely determine the extent of signification
of common names</i>.” By the omission of the article
<i>a</i>, then, a particular river is “most precisely
determined,”—and, in print, <span class="xxpn"
id="p189">{p189}</span> cap­i­tal­iz­ing the “R” of
the adjective makes assurance doubly sure. But
since long-established usage determines that “Long
<span class="spwdspb">Island,” “Harper’s</span>
<span class="spwdspb">Ferry,” “Lake</span> <span
class="spwdspb">Ontario,” “George</span> Washington,”
etc., shall have both words put up, uniformity can be
secured only by extending that mode of cap­i­tal­i­za­tion
to all words in the same category—unless, as we have
intimated, each exception be mentioned individually,
so that every printer may “clearly designate” (so to
speak) what is expected of him.</p>

<p class="padtopc">9. A word usually put down may be put up, or
<i>vice versa</i>, by reason of propinquity to some other
word which is in the opposite category as to cap­i­tal­i­za­tion.</p>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>We are not aware that this rule, or an equivalent to it, has
been formulated until now, but we have known changes in
cap­i­tal­iz­ing to be made in compliance with the principle of
the rule.</p>

<p>A printed report (Reform School) reads:</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>The visitors were cordially received and welcomed by the
Superintendent and matron of the Board of Trustees.</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>The style required that, usually, “Superintendent” should
be up, and “Matron” down, as printed above. But when the
words are so near each other, the small <i>m</i> looks—without
regard to the maxim, <i>Place aux dames</i>—as if the lady were
subjected to an intentional slight. We think it had been better
thus:</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>The visitors were cordially .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. welcomed by the Superintendent
and the Matron of the Board of Trustees.</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>By the way, this insertion of <i>the</i> before
“Matron” shows that the Matron was not also the
Superintendent—thus illustrating Murray’s remark
on the “two articles,” mentioned near the close of
the note under Rule 8, <i>ante</i>. <span class="xxpn"
id="p190">{p190}</span></p>

<p>This clause also occurs:</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>Friends of the school residing in the city and District.</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>Here “city” is put down, as if of less consequence than the
outlying parts of the “District” [of Columbia].</p>

<p>That is correct, according to usual office style; but had
“city” been put up, or “district” down, it would have been
more pleasing to the eye, and would not, probably, have
wrought any mischief. In the use of capitals, rules should
be, and in fact are, very bendable. When we write “the
<i>member</i> of Congress,” member is down, though we capitalize
“the Delegate from the Territory of Blank.” But when
“Member and Delegate” occur in the same sentence, both
words are put up, agreeably to Rule 9.</p>

<p>It is a good rule adopted in some printing-offices, that where
the same appellation is given to several persons or public
bodies, only the highest in rank shall be honored with capitals.</p>

<p>For instance, in speaking of the highest tribunal in the land,
put up “the Supreme Court”; but if a State court is spoken
of put the initials down, thus,—“the supreme court of Minnesota,”
as in the following paragraph:</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>This view of the law was sustained by the supreme court
of Louisiana, and, upon writ of error, by the Supreme Court
of the United States (Day <i>vs.</i> Micou, 18 Wall., 156).</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>So, also, “the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme
Court”—capitals; “the chief justice of the supreme court of
Maryland”—lower-case; the highest “Commissioner” in
any Governmental Department, up; a road commissioner,
down. A steady adherence to this rule might aid students and
others to discriminate between the “Governor” of a State and
the “governor” of a family; and if a decision is rendered by
“the full bench of the Supreme Court,” one would know that
no appeal could be had,—while if a decision is made by “the
supreme court,” it might, perhaps, be carried up on appeal.</p>

<p>But this distinction can never be fully carried out. We
have known it to be set aside by the
following direction <span class="xxpn" id="p191">{p191}</span>
marking out a “special style” for a volume of “Decisions”:
“Capitalize Supreme Court, Court of Claims, Circuit Court,
District Court, and Supreme Court of Tennessee.” Besides,
Great Men are inimical to small letters. The President of a
Village Lyceum insists on being put up as high as the President
of the United States,—in fact, the said <i>p</i>resident may
feel that he is “a bi<i>g</i>er man” than the <i>P</i>resident.</p>

<p>And if, on the other hand, as some proof-readers have contended,
cap­i­tal­i­za­tion should be employed to distinguish, in
print, our Government from every foreign Government, the
effect would be almost too ridiculous to state; as:</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>The Chief Executive of the United States had an interview
with the chief executive of Mexico. The President said to
the president, “How do you do?”—and the president replied,
“I am better than ever I was before, for I see the President
of the Great Colossus of the North.”—“And I,” rejoined the
President, “am delighted with the honor of conversing with
the great colossus of the south.” Here the president bowed
to the President, and the President shook the president’s hand.
The One then took his Oysters on the Half-Shell, and the other
his oysters on the half-shell.</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>The style was once verging toward something
very ridiculous, and might have proceeded to the
above extreme had not a distinguished Secretary
of State, several years ago, made some well-timed
suggestions.</p>

<p>If the office style require <span
class="spwdspb">“board,” “bureau,”</span> etc.,
referring to a corporation, or collection of
individuals, to be put down, cases like the following
should form exceptions:</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>The festive board was graced by the festive board of directors
of the Rochester saw-mills.</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>It should be printed “Board of Directors.”</p></div>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>A new bureau has been forwarded to the new bureau of
musical notation.</p></div>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>Put up “Bureau of Musical Notation.”</p>

<p>Thus, by a judicious selection and arrangement of capital
and lower-case letters, Boards and Bureaus
of gentlemen may <span class="xxpn" id="p192">{p192}</span>
be readily dif­fer­en­tiated from mere furniture, mahogany or
black-walnut boards and bureaus.</p>

<p>The principle of a change of style by reason of juxtaposition,
is recognized in the following direction for printing an
important work on the fisheries: “Put quantities, measurements,
distances, and sums of money in figures; numbers of
men and vessels spelled, <i>except where large numbers occur
together</i>.”</p></div></div><!--section-->

<h3 class="h3a">RECAPITULATION.</h3>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>In the preceding part of this chapter we felt it necessary to
give many examples, and enter upon some discussion of styles.
To save time and trouble in turning many leaves to find some
particular rule, we give below, all the rules in compact form,
with but brief, if any, examples in il­lus­tra­tion.</p></div>

<p class="padtopc"><span class="smcap">R<b>ULE</b></span> I. The
initial letter of every sentence should be a
capital.</p>

<div class="dobsn">
<p>This rule has been long established. It scarcely requires

<div class="dpp00">Like angel-visits, few and far between.—<i>Campbell.</i></div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="padtopc"><span
class="smcap">R<b>ULE</b></span> III. Principal words
in the titles of books, of important documents, of
proclamations, of edicts, of conventions, and words
of especial distinction in monographs, should be put
up.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>There is in the library a book entitled,
“An Interesting Narrative of the Travels of
James Bruce, Esq., into Abyssinia, to Discover
the Source of the Nile.” <span class="xxpn"
id="p193">{p193}</span></p></div>

<p class="padtopc"><span
class="smcap">R<b>ULE</b></span> IV. Names and
appellations of the Supreme Being should be
capitalized.</p>

<p class="padtopc"><span
class="smcap">R<b>ULE</b></span> V. Names of ancient
Greek and Roman divinities, and of all pagan and
heathen gods, should be put up.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>Æsculapius restored many to life, of which Pluto complained
to Jupiter, who struck Æsculapius with thunder, but
Apollo, angry at the death of his son, killed the Cyclops who
made the thunderbolts.—<i>Lempriere.</i></p></div>

<p class="padtopc"><span
class="smcap">R<b>ULE</b></span> VI. The pronoun I,
and the interjection O, should always be put up.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>Here am I; send me, O king!</p></div>

<p class="padtopc"><span class="smcap">R<b>ULE</b></span>
VII. Some words which are put down when
spelled in full, are put up when contracted.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>The honorable the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>

<p>The Hon. the Secretary of the Treasury.</p></div>

<p class="padtopc"><span class="smcap">R<b>ULE</b></span>
VIII. Names of persons, of things personified,
of nations, countries, cities, towns, streets, ships,
etc., should be put up.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpp00">And well may Doubt, the mother of Dismay,</div>
<div class="dpp00">Pause at her martyr’s tomb.—<i>Campbell.</i></div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="padtopc"><span
class="smcap">R<b>ULE</b></span> IX. A word usually
put down may be put up, or <i>vice versa</i>, by reason
of propinquity to some other word which is in the
opposite category as to cap­i­tal­i­za­tion.</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p>The Secretary of War complimented the Secretary of the

<p>Shall the Choctaw Nation or this Nation adjust the northern
boundary? <span class="xxpn" id="p194">{p194}</span></p></div>

<p class="padtopc">Before leaving the subject of
cap­i­tal­i­za­tion, we must observe that there is
diversity among authors and printers in regard to the
use of capitals when two or more questions occur in
succession. The rule generally given is, “Capitalize
each question”: but the exceptions are so numerous,
depending on some common relation to a term expressed
or understood (<i>see</i> Obs. 30 and 31, Rule 29, Chap.
V., <i>ante</i>), that we forbear indorsing the rule to
which we have above referred. Indeed, it often happens
that questions occurring singly are so connected with
what goes before, that they do not require to be
capitalized. Each case must be settled by the judgment
of editor or author,—there is no common standard
of reference, as can easily be shown by comparing
different editions of the same work. In Buckingham’s
Shakspeare, printed in Boston, we read in As you Like
It, Act 5, Sc. 2:</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p><i>Orl.</i> Is’t possible that on so little acquaintance you should
like her? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And will you persever, etc.,</p></div>

<p class="pcontinue">the last question having a
capital <i>A</i>; but in the London edition of French &amp;
Co., we <span class="nowrap">have—</span></p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<p><i>Orl.</i> Is’t possible that on so little acquaintance you should
like her? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and will you persever, etc.,</p></div>

<p class="pcontinue">in which the last of the several
questions has a lower-case <i>a</i>. Every editor endeavors
to capitalize correctly—by suiting himself.</p>

Chapter until they become ſo familiar with ancient
and nearly forgotten Letters as to be able to enjoy

<p>To Printers who have “ſerved their Time” in
the Book-offices of the Eaſt or the early ſettled
Cities of the South and Weſt, a Chapter like this
may ſeem wholly ſuperfluous. But in a Country
like ours, where new Towns and Cities are daily
ſpringing into Exiſtence, daily Newſpapers ſpringing
up with them, it often happens that Boys and
young Men who have had but ſcanty Schooling
are taken as Apprentices to learn the Art of Arts.
Many of theſe become rapid and

Compoſitors,
and in Proceſs of Time drift to Cities where
are Printing-offices with more Varieties of Type
than the new Comers have been accuſtomed to,—among
the reſt, Old Style, both in its ancient and
modernized Forms; and it is, in good Part, for
the Benefit of theſe that we devote a few Pages to
Old Style.</p>

<p>In purſuing our
<span class="nowrap">Subje<img class="iglyphc" src="images/ligctupright.png"
 width="58" height="110" alt="ct ligature, upright" /></span> we
ſhall paſs by <span class="xxpn" id="p197">{p197}</span>
Caxton, who, as Everybody knows, introduced movable
Types into England in the ſeventh Year of the
fourth Edward, make but brief Mention of Caſlon
(1692–1766), who about the Year 1720, made
Matrices and call genuine and beautiful old-ſtyle
Type,—and come
<span class="nowrap">dire<img class="iglyphc" src="images/ligctupright.png"
 width="58" height="110" alt="ct ligature, upright" />ly</span>
to the <span class="nowrap">Fa<img class="iglyphc" src="images/ligctupright.png"
 width="58" height="110" alt="ct ligature, upright" /></span> that, in
1843, an Engliſh Printer deſired to reprint in Old
Style a Book of the Time of Charles II. The old
Matrices of Caſlon were found (<i>v.</i> Brit. Encyc.),
and from them a Font was caſt, which, with improved
Preſſes, etc., gave a better Impreſſion than
had been obtained in Caſlon’s Time. Since then
(1843), the Demand for Old Style has ſteadily increaſed,
both in England and America, and our
Founders have produced a modernized Old Style;
in which, however, it is thought by many that
Legibility has been ſacrificed to Beauty and general
<span class="nowrap">Effe<img class="iglyphc" src="images/ligctupright.png"
 width="58" height="110" alt="ct ligature, upright" />.</span>
Our Purpoſe here is to treat of the
earlier Style, which ſtill reaches Printing-offices
occaſionally as Copy, and in which Programmes
for “Old Folks’ Concerts,” and alſo ſome Pamphlets,
are printed even in theſe Days.</p>

<p>In Old Style, <i>s final</i> is a ſhort <i>s</i>; in all other
Parts of a Word, even if it is the laſt Letter of a
Syllable of a Word divided at the End of a Line,
the long, kerned “ſ” is uſed. To prevent breaking
the Kern the long “ſ” was caſt
in the ſame <span class="xxpn" id="p198">{p198}</span>
Matrix with ſuch Letters as it would otherwiſe
interfere with,—the two, or in Caſe of double <i>ſ</i>
the three, Letters forming one Type; juſt as “f”
is now ligated to other Letters, as fi, ffl, etc.</p>

<p>And here, while ſpeaking of Ligatures, we would
fain digreſs a Moment,—even at the Expenſe of
lengthening our old-ſtyle Chapter,—to remark
that there are ſome interfering Combinations for
which Ligatures have not been caſt. We have
ſeen Book-catalogues in which the Word “<i>Illuſtrated</i>”
frequently occurred, having the Kerns of
the italic <i>I</i> and its Neighbor <i>l</i>, one or both, broken
off. The ſame happens when the Word “Illinois”
is ſet in italic, unleſs the Compoſitor inſert a thin
Space to keep the Letters from encroaching on
each other’s Territory. The ſame Method muſt
be obſerved when the Combination of <i>f</i> with <i>b</i>, <i>h</i>,
or <i>k</i>, is met with; as in Hofburg, Hofhoof, and
Hoffkirchen; otherwiſe one or more Letters will
preſent a mutilated Appearance on the Proof-ſheet.</p>

<p>An italic ſhort <i>s</i> ligated with <i>t</i>, formerly in
Uſe, does not ſeem to have remained long in the
Printer’s Caſe; but—perhaps from the Beauty of
its Curves—the
<span class="nowrap">“<img class="iglyphc" src="images/ligctupright.png"

<p>We conclude this Portion of our Work by preſenting
ſome Fac-ſimiles of Old Style, produced
by Photogravure. The firſt is Part of a Page
from “Annals of King George,” printed in London,
in 1717.</p>

<p>The next is a Fac-ſimile of four roman and three
italic Lines from T. B. Reed’s “Hiſtory of Printing.”
Theſe ſeven Lines were printed from Type
caſt in the Matrices made by the elder Caſlon,
in 1720. They ſhow an immenſe Improvement
when compared with the Page of the “Annals”
executed but three Years before.</p>

<p>The third Sample is from Fry &amp; Steele’s “Specimens
of Printing Type,” dated 1794; while the
fourth, from the Foundry of Caſlon the younger,
dated 1796, having dropped the long “ſ” and its
Ligatures, informs us of the Period when the Old
was giving Place
to the New. <span class="xxpn" id="p200">{p200}</span></p>

<span class="hsmall">TECHNICAL TERMS USED IN THIS WORK.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">C<b>ASE.</b></span> A frame
divided into boxes, or compartments, for holding
types. The upper case contains capitals; the lower
case, small letters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C<b>HAPEL.</b></span> An
association of workmen in a printing-office.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C<b>HASE.</b></span> An iron
frame in which the pages of matter are locked up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D<b>OUBLET.</b></span> A portion of a take repeated by the compositor.
For instance: “It is of no use to lament our misfortunes, of
no benefit to grieve over past mistakes.” Suppose the compositor
to have set up as far as the second “no” inclusive,—he
then glances at his copy for the following words, but his
eye catches the <i>first</i> “no,” and he resets what is already in his
stick. Of course the proof will read thus: “It is of no use to
lament our misfortunes, of no use to lament our misfortunes,
of no benefit to grieve over,” etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F<b>ORM.</b></span> The pages of matter inclosed in the chase.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">G<b>ALLEY.</b></span> A frame which receives the contents of the composing-stick.
When the stick is full, it is emptied upon a
galley.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I<b>MPOSE.</b></span> To lay the made-up pages of matter on the stone,
and fit on the chase in order to carry the form to press.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I<b>NDENTION.</b></span> The blank space at the beginning of a common
paragraph, or of a line of poetry, etc. When the first
line is not indented, while the following lines of the paragraph
have a blank space before them, the paragraph is said to be
set with a “hanging indention.”</p>

<div class="dblockquot">
<i>Specimen of Hanging Indention.</i>

<p class="phanga">Be it enacted by the Senate and
House of Representatives, in General Court assembled,
and by the authority of the same.</p></div>

<p id="p203"><span class="smcap">J<b>USTIFY.</b></span> To insert spaces between the words of a line of
type, so that the line shall exactly fit the width of the stick.</p>

<p><i>To</i> <span class="smcap">L<b>OCK</b></span> <span class="smmaj">UP A</span>
<span class="smcap">F<b>ORM</b></span> is to drive quoins (wedges) in such a
manner as to hold the type firmly in the chase.</p>

<p><i>To</i> <span class="smcap">M<b>AKE</b></span> <span class="smmaj">UP</span> is to adjust the matter in pages of equal
length, as nearly as may be, for imposition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M<b>ATTER.</b></span> Types set up, so as to form a word or words.
When it is to be distributed (put back into the cases), it is
known as “dead” matter. If not yet printed, or if destined
for further use, it is called “live” matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O<b>UT.</b></span> A portion of a take, accidentally omitted by a compositor.
An “out” is generally referable, as in the case of
the “doublet,” to the recurrence of some word, or sequence of
letters. For instance: a take had in it, “He injured his foot,
by wearing a tight boot.” The proof had, only, “He injured
his foot.” The compositor had the whole sentence in his mind;
and having set the final letters “oot,” referred these to the last
word, “boot,” and thought he had set the whole sentence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Q<b>UÆRE</b>,</span> or <span class="smcap">Q<b>UERY</b>,</span> variously abbreviated, as <i>Qu.</i> <i>Qy.</i> or
<i>Qr.</i>, and sometimes represented by an in­ter­ro­ga­tion point, is
written in the margin of the proof-sheet, to draw the author’s
attention to some passage about which the proof-reader is in
doubt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">R<b>EVISE.</b></span> The second proof is a revise of the first, the third
is a revise of the second, etc. <i>To</i> <span class="smcap">R<b>EVISE</b></span> is to compare the
second, or any subsequent proof, with a preceding one, to see
whether the proper corrections have been made.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S<b>HOOTING-STICK.</b></span> A wedge-shaped piece of wood for
tightening and loosening the quoins that wedge up the pages
in a chase.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S<b>IGNATURE.</b></span> A letter or figure at the bottom of the first
page of every sheet. It denotes the proper order of the sheets
in binding.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S<b>PACE.</b></span> If a line of type be divided by vertical planes into
exact squares, each of these squares occupies the space of an
<i>em</i>, or <i>em-quadrat</i>. Ems are used to indent common paragraphs,
and to separate sentences in
the same paragraph. <span class="xxpn" id="p204">{p204}</span>
The next thinner space is the <i>en</i>, or <i>en-quadrat</i>, which is one-half
of the em. The next is one-third of the em, and is called
the <i>three-em space</i>; next, one-fourth of the em is the <i>four-em
space</i>; then, one-fifth of the em is the <i>five-em space</i>. Thinner
than any of these is the <i>hair-space</i>. The three-em space is
generally used in composition; the other sizes are needed in
justifying.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S<b>TICK</b></span>
<span class="smcap">(C<b>OMPOSING</b>-S<b>TICK</b>)</span>.
A frame of iron or steel, in
which the compositor sets up the type. By means of a movable
slide, it can be adjusted to the required length of line.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S<b>TONE.</b></span> A table of marble, or other stone, on which forms
are imposed, and on which they are placed for correction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T<b>AKE.</b></span> That portion of copy which the compositor takes to
put in type (or “set up”)
at one time.</p>

<p class="p-adnote">“What can be said that is more
eloquent praise than that Charles Dudley Warner has

declamation days, are limited to five minutes each for
the delivery of “pieces.” There is a great complaint

has often marred the desired effects. To obviate
these difficulties new “Five-Minute” books have been
prepared by a competent teacher.</p>

<p class="p-book">EVERY-DAY BUSINESS, PRACTICAL NOTES
ON ITS DETAILS</p>

<p class="p-adnote"><i>Arranged for Young People
by M. S. EMERY</i><br /> Price, cloth, 50 cents</p>

<p class="p-adnote">An accurate knowledge of how
to attend to the every-day affairs of a business
life is, indeed, a most valuable possession. The
requirements of modern business life are manifold
and exacting, demanding technical information, and,
besides, quite a degree of what may justly be termed
“cultivation.” This valuable and indispensable book
covers a wide range of information of much importance,
and is designed as a text-book for schools, and for
ready reference for young people and those who need
such instruction as it contains. It treats in an
attractive and clear manner subjects which bear on
every-day callings, like “Letter-writing,” by which
so large a percentage of business is conducted;
“Bills, Receipts, and <span class="spwdspb">Accounts;”
“Post-Office</span> Business,” with instructions
regarding late advantages and scope of accommodation;
<span class="spwdspb">“Telegrams,” “Express</span>
<span class="spwdspb">Business,” “United</span>
States <span class="spwdspb">Money,” “Savings</span>
<span class="spwdspb">Banks,” “National</span>
<span class="spwdspb">Banks,” “Bank</span> <span
class="spwdspb">Checks,” “Notes</span> and <span
class="spwdspb">Drafts,” “Mortgages,”</span>
“Investment and <span class="spwdspb">Speculation,”
“Taxes,”</span> “Fire Insurance,” and “Life
Insurance.” These are topics conveying a general idea
of the worth of the book—topics about which business
men must know, and covering that which they who would
be business men must learn. Keeping relatively abreast
of modern methods, the educators of our day see the
necessity of imparting <i>business knowledge</i>, as well
as that which is purely scientific, historical, or
literary in its nature; hence, the adaptability of
“Every-Day Business” to the necessities of American
schools and our progressive ways of life.</p>

<p class="p-adnote">“This beautiful quarto volume
presents the ideas of Delsarte in words which all
may understand. It is explicit and comprehensible.
No one can read this book or study its twenty-two
graceful and graphic il­lus­tra­tions without perceiving
the possibility of adding strength and expression to
gestures and movements, as well as simplicity and
ease. Mr. Turveydrop went through life with universal
approval, simply by his admirable ‘deportment.’ Every
young person may profitably take a hint from his
success, and this book will be found invaluable as an
instructor.”—<i>Woman’s Journal</i>, Boston.</p>

<p class="p-adnote">“‘Flexibility and grace’ are the
watchwords of this great teacher, and it must be
conceded that the charming young ladies who serve
as models throughout the book have their share of
these two desiderata of expression; this book gives
an altogether charming insight into Delsarte’s
system, and no young lady who desires to acquire
ease of manner and grace of carriage could do better
than to read it carefully. The style is quite in
keeping with the subject, light, graceful, and
entertaining.”—<i>American Stationer.</i></p>

<p class="p-adnote">“The plan of the book is unique, attractive, and thoroughly philosophical.

made subordinate to this great aim. In the first few chapters, the method of
studying a given subject is fully explained and illustrated.”—<i>True Education.</i></p>

<p>The turned comma in ‹M&#x2bb;Donough› on page
<a href="#p119" title="to &#x70;age 119">119</a> is a glyph (Unicode character [‹&#x2bb;› <span
class="smmaj">U+02BB</span>; modifier let­ter turned
com­ma]) that is not well sup­port­ed in cur­rent
brow­sers. It is retained in the simple text
edition, but an image is substituted in the html,
epub, and mobi editions. On page
<a href="#p122" title="to &#x70;age 122">122</a>, the <i>x</i> with
combining cedilla has been rendered as an image in
all but the text edition. Other Unicode characters
rendered as images include: Arabic semi­colon, double
high-reversed-9 quo­ta­tion mark, single high-reversed-9
quo­ta­tion mark, as­ter­ism, double ver­ti­cal line, and
white right point­ing index. Many glyphs that are not
included in the Unicode system are represented as ‹[Symbol]›
in the text edition, and as images in the other editions.</p>

Chapter VIII was originally printed
in an Old Style which included the long “ſ” and
several obsolete or font-dependent ligatures such as
“ct”. Sadly, only the <i>ſ</i> can be represented in this
ebook. For the html, epub, and mobi editions, an image of
the <i>ct</i> ligature has been provided. But to see all
the ligatures as originally printed, you must seek out
the original page scans.</li>
